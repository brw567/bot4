## Core Principles

1. **Profitability First**: Every feature must contribute to profitability
2. **No Fake Implementations**: All code must be real and working
3. **Production Ready**: Build for production from the start
4. **Auto-Adaptation**: System should learn and improve over time
5. **Risk Management**: Never compromise on risk controls
6. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency
7. **Monitoring**: Track everything, alert on anomalies
8. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before deployment

## Technical Requirements
