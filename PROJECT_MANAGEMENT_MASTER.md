## 🔄 TASK DEPENDENCIES & CRITICAL PATH

### Critical Path (MUST complete in order):
1. **Layer 0**: Safety Systems (160h) - BLOCKS EVERYTHING
2. **Layer 1.6**: 🔴 CODE DEDUPLICATION (160h) - CRITICAL TECHNICAL DEBT
3. **Layer 1.7**: 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE RE-VERIFICATION (120h) - VALIDATE ALL REFACTORING
4. **Layer 1**: Data Foundation (remaining 120h) - Required for ML
5. **Layer 2**: Risk Management (180h) - Required for trading
6. **Layer 3**: ML Pipeline (420h) - Core intelligence

- Technical debt compounds exponentially if skipped

### Parallel Work Possible:
- Layer 6 (Infrastructure) can progress alongside Layer 3-5
- Exchange connectors can be built incrementally
- UI dashboards can be developed in parallel
