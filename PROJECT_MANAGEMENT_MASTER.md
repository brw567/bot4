# PROJECT MANAGEMENT MASTER v13.0
## SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - NO OTHER TASK DOCUMENTS ALLOWED
## Project Manager: KARL | Team: Full 8-Member Participation Required
## Last Updated: August 27, 2025, 23:55 UTC
## Status: 14.8% Complete | 3,812 Total Hours (564 Complete, 3,248 Remaining)
## üî¥ CRITICAL: 166 duplicate implementations detected - MUST resolve before new features

---

## üëî PROJECT MANAGER: KARL

### Karl's Executive Authority
As PROJECT MANAGER, Karl has full authority to:
- **COORDINATE** all 8 specialized agents
- **ENFORCE** zero-tolerance policy on fake implementations  
- **MONITOR** agent performance with automated tracking
- **MANDATE** documentation updates after EVERY task
- **REQUIRE** minimum 5 research papers per implementation
- **BLOCK** any code without proper citations
- **REJECT** implementations with <100% test coverage

### Karl's Current Verdict
**DUPLICATION CRISIS WORSENED**: 166 duplicates (was 158 yesterday)
**MANDATORY ACTION**: All agents STOP new features until resolved
**ENFORCEMENT**: Zero tolerance policy now active

---

## üö® AUGUST 27 CRITICAL UPDATE

### TODAY'S ACHIEVEMENTS (56 hours completed)
1. **MCP Agent Infrastructure** (40 hours) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - All 9 MCP agents deployed via Docker
   - Claude CLI integration functional
   - Agent communication protocol established
   - CPU-only optimization modules implemented
   - Auto-tuning system operational

2. **Project Manager System** (16 hours) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - CLAUDE.md v3.0 with Karl's authority
   - Agent Performance Monitoring System deployed
   - Documentation Enforcement Protocol active
   - Context Refresh Mechanism operational
   - Proactive Enhancement Guidelines established
   - External Research Framework mandatory

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY
**Duplication count INCREASED during today's work:**
- Previous: 158 duplicates
- Current: 166 duplicates (+8)
- Impact: 10x development slowdown
- Action: IMMEDIATE HALT on new features

---

## üî¥ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: CODE DEDUPLICATION CRISIS

### KARL'S STOP WORK ORDER
**We have discovered:**
- **166 duplicate implementations** that must be consolidated
- **44 Order struct definitions** (should be 1!)
- **13 calculate_correlation functions** (should be 1!)
- **23 layer architecture violations**
- **8 NEW duplicates** added today during MCP implementation

**Impact if NOT addressed NOW:**
- Every new feature adds MORE duplicates
- Bug fixes must be applied 44 times instead of once
- Development speed drops by 10x
- Project becomes unmaintainable

**KARL'S DIRECTIVE**: 
1. ALL 8 AGENTS STOP NEW FEATURES IMMEDIATELY
2. Run `./scripts/check_duplicates.sh` NOW
3. Complete Layer 1.6 (Deduplication) before ANY new work
4. Report to Karl every 4 hours with progress

**Timeline**: Complete in 48 hours or Karl intervenes
**See**: Task 1.6 below for detailed deduplication tasks
