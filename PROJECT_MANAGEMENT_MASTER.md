## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION: FIRST TASK TO START

### TASK 0.6: CPU Feature Detection System (16 hours)
**Layer**: 0 (Safety Systems)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Prevents crashes on 70% of hardware
**Owner**: Sam (Lead) + Jordan (Support)
**Review**: All 8 team members

#### Why This Task First:
1. **Blocks all SIMD work** - Cannot proceed without proper detection
2. **Prevents instant crashes** - Current code fails on non-AVX512 CPUs
3. **Quick win** - 16 hours for massive stability improvement
4. **Enables testing** - Can run on diverse hardware after completion

#### Implementation Requirements:
```rust
// Required structure
pub struct CpuFeatures {
    has_avx512: bool,
    has_avx2: bool,
    has_sse4: bool,
}

impl CpuFeatures {
    pub fn detect() -> Self {
        // Runtime detection using CPUID
    }
    
    pub fn select_implementation<T>(&self) -> Box<dyn SimdProcessor<T>> {
        if self.has_avx512 {
            Box::new(Avx512Processor::new())
        } else if self.has_avx2 {
            Box::new(Avx2Processor::new())
        } else {
            Box::new(ScalarProcessor::new())
        }
    }
}
```

#### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Runtime detection of CPU features
- ✅ Automatic selection of best implementation
- ✅ Scalar fallback for compatibility
- ✅ AVX2 intermediate path
- ✅ Zero crashes on any x86_64 CPU
- ✅ Performance tests showing graceful degradation
- ✅ 100% test coverage including mock CPUs

#### External Research Required:
1. Study CPUID instruction usage in Rust
2. Review `is_x86_feature_detected!` macro
3. Analyze popular crates: `raw-cpuid`, `cupid`
4. Benchmark overhead of runtime dispatch
5. Study Linux kernel CPU detection

#### Team Collaboration:
- **Sam**: Implement core detection logic
- **Jordan**: Performance benchmarking
- **Morgan**: Mathematical correctness verification
- **Quinn**: Risk assessment of fallback paths
- **Casey**: Integration with existing SIMD code
- **Riley**: Comprehensive test suite
- **Avery**: Data flow implications
- **Alex**: Architecture review

#### Definition of Done:
1. Code review passed by all 8 members
2. Benchmarks show <1% overhead for dispatch
3. Tested on: Intel (AVX512), AMD (AVX2), older CPUs (SSE4)
4. Documentation complete with examples
5. CI/CD updated to test all paths
