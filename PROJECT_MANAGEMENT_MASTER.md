## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks:
1. **Latency miss**: Implement caching, optimize hot paths
2. **Memory leaks**: Use MiMalloc, implement monitoring
3. **Model overfitting**: Time-series CV, walk-forward analysis
4. **Exchange API changes**: Abstract interfaces, version management
5. **Data quality issues**: Multiple validation layers

### Business Risks:
1. **Market regime change**: Adaptive strategies, regime detection
2. **Liquidity crisis**: Position limits, emergency liquidation
3. **Exchange failure**: Multi-venue support, failover
4. **Regulatory changes**: Compliance monitoring, audit trail
5. **Capital loss**: Stop-loss, position sizing, kill switch

## 📝 APPENDIX: MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS

### Kelly Criterion
```
f* = (p(b+1) - 1) / b
where:
  f* = optimal fraction to bet
  p = probability of winning
  b = odds (win/loss ratio)
  
Safety adjustment: f_actual = 0.25 * f*
```

### GARCH(1,1) Model
```
σ²ₜ = ω + α·ε²ₜ₋₁ + β·σ²ₜ₋₁
where:
  σ²ₜ = variance at time t
  ω = long-term variance
  α = ARCH coefficient
  β = GARCH coefficient
  ε²ₜ₋₁ = squared residual
```

### Avellaneda-Stoikov Market Making
```
δ* = γσ²(T-t) + (2/γ)ln(1+γ/k)
r = S - q·γσ²(T-t)
where:
  δ* = optimal spread
  γ = risk aversion
  σ = volatility
  T-t = time remaining
  k = market order arrival rate
  r = reservation price
  q = inventory
```

### Almgren-Chriss Execution
```
x(t) = X·sinh(κ(T-t))/sinh(κT)
v(t) = X·κ·cosh(κ(T-t))/sinh(κT)
where:
  x(t) = position at time t
  v(t) = trading rate
  X = total shares
  κ = sqrt(λσ²/η)
  λ = risk aversion
  η = temporary impact
```

### Expected Shortfall (CVaR)
```
ES_α = E[X | X ≤ VaR_α]
where:
  α = confidence level (e.g., 0.05)
  VaR_α = Value at Risk at α
```
