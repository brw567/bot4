# Bot4 Development Session Summary
## Date: January 18, 2025 (Evening Session)
## Team: FULL TEAM Collaboration
## Focus: Documentation Updates & 5-Layer LSTM Implementation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ SESSION OBJECTIVES (FROM USER)

**User's Instructions:**
"Alex, Team, update all the docs, including LLM optimised, and continue on the tasks as one team (the whole team on each task!), NO SIMPLIFICATIONS, NO FAKES, NO PLACEHODERS. Ensure integrity across all the new features and the highest quality of the code. Do not forget about the HW optimizations, and math optimizations for the features. I expect the full involvement of our SMEs with them digging deep and even searching in external available resources for possible enhancements and optimizations."
