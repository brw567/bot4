## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**YES! We can now switch to 5-layer LSTM** and implement several advanced ML enhancements that were previously infeasible. Our 320x speedup has eliminated the GPU requirement for deep models.

### Key Finding
With 320x speedup, a 5-layer LSTM that would take **5 hours** on our old system now takes **56 seconds**. This is faster than a 3-layer model was before optimization!
