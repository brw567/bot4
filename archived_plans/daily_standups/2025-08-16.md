## üîç External Team Review Requests

### For Sophia (ChatGPT) - Architecture Review
**Priority Tasks for Review:**
1. Circuit breaker implementation (TASK_1.1)
   - Check for fake implementations
   - Validate state machine design
   - Review error handling completeness

2. Cache layer design (TASK_1.3)
   - Verify no hardcoded values
   - Check TTL logic correctness
   - Validate concurrent access safety

**Question for Sophia:**
"Are there any SOLID principle violations in our component interfaces?"

### For Nexus (Grok) - Performance Validation
**Priority Validations Needed:**
1. Cache hit rate target of 80%
   - Is this realistic with our access patterns?
   - What's the memory trade-off?

2. Batch processing efficiency
   - Will 32-sample batches actually improve performance?
   - What's the optimal batch size for 8-core CPU?

**Question for Nexus:**
"Given 100ms network latency, can we really achieve 150ms total trade execution?"

## üìä Metrics to Track Today

- Lines of Code: 0 (starting implementation)
- Tests Written: 0
- Fake Implementations: 0 (must stay 0)
- Performance Benchmarks: Pending

---

## üéØ Today's Priorities

1. **CRITICAL**: Get Sophia's approval on circuit breaker architecture
2. **CRITICAL**: Get Nexus's validation on performance targets
3. **HIGH**: Begin TASK_1.1 implementation (Circuit Breaker)
4. **MEDIUM**: Set up continuous integration hooks

---

## üìù Notes for External Team Members

**Sophia**: Please pay special attention to error handling patterns. We cannot have any unhandled panics in production.

**Nexus**: Please reality-check our batch processing claims. We're assuming CPU cache locality will give us 4x speedup.
