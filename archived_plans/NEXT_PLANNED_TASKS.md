## üö® IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS (Must Complete Before ANY Trading)

### Phase 2 Critical Patches (3-5 days)
**Owner**: Casey & Sam  
**Deadline**: January 22, 2025  
**Status**: NOT STARTED ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Task 1: Variable Trading Cost Model (Casey - 2 days)
```rust
// Location: crates/trading_engine/src/costs/
pub struct ComprehensiveCostModel {
    exchange_fees: TieredFeeStructure,     // 0.02-0.10% per trade
    funding_costs: FundingRateCalculator,   // 0.01-0.1% per 8hr
    slippage_model: MarketImpactModel,      // 0.05-0.5% per trade
    spread_costs: SpreadCostEstimator,      // Half bid-ask spread
}
```
**Impact**: Without this, losing $1,800/month in unaccounted costs

#### Task 2: Partial Fill Awareness (Sam - 3 days)
```rust
// Location: crates/trading_engine/src/orders/
pub struct FillAwareStopLoss {
    entries: Vec<(Price, Quantity, Timestamp)>,
    weighted_avg_entry: Price,
    
    pub fn update_on_fill(&mut self, fill: Fill) {
        self.recalculate_weighted_average();
        self.adjust_stop_loss();  // CRITICAL
    }
}
```
**Impact**: Incorrect stop-loss levels = wrong P&L tracking

3. Prioritize sentiment over L2 data
4. Skip paper trading phase
5. Disable panic conditions

1. Complete trading cost model FIRST
2. Implement partial fill awareness
3. Use 25% Kelly MAX
4. Prioritize L2 microstructure
5. Test all kill switches

## üí∞ Financial Impact

### Cost Changes
```yaml
before_sophia:
  data: $2,500/month (sentiment-heavy)
  trading: $0 (unaccounted)
  total: $2,500/month
  
after_sophia:
  data: $1,500/month (L2-focused)
  trading: $1,800/month (now accounted)
  total: $3,300/month
  net_increase: $800/month
```

### Break-even Requirements
- Need additional 0.8% monthly return
- At $100k capital: $800/month profit required
- Achievable with proper cost management

---

## üìä Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Trading without cost model** = Guaranteed losses
2. **Full Kelly sizing** = Account blow-up
3. **No partial fill handling** = Wrong P&L
4. **Sentiment over L2** = Wrong signals
5. **No panic conditions** = Catastrophic losses

### Mitigation
1. ‚úÖ Phase 2 patches address items 1 & 3
2. ‚úÖ Phase 3.5 Week 1 addresses item 2
3. ‚úÖ Phase 4 restructure addresses item 4
4. ‚úÖ Phase 3.5 Week 3 addresses item 5

## Conclusion

The next immediate priority is completing the **Phase 2 critical patches** before ANY trading can begin. These address Sophia's most critical concerns about unaccounted trading costs and partial fill handling.

Once complete, we proceed with the enhanced Phase 3.5 (6 weeks) which incorporates all of Sophia's risk management and signal processing requirements.

Phase 4 runs in parallel with restructured priorities focusing on L2 microstructure data rather than sentiment, saving $1,000/month initially.

**Total time to trading readiness**: 8-10 weeks from today.
