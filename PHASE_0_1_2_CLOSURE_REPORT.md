## Unclosed Legacy Items Analysis

### From Old Task Lists (Non-Blocking):
These were found in PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_MASTER.md but are either:
- Duplicates of completed work
- Misplaced Phase 3+ items
- Already implemented differently

```
Week 2 Priorities (Remaining):
- [DONE] Statistical distributions ✅ (completed as Nexus requirement)
- [DONE] Timestamp validation ✅ (completed as Sophia requirement)
- [DONE] Validation filters ✅ (completed as Sophia requirement)
- [DEFERRED] PostgreSQL repository → Phase 3
- [DEFERRED] REST API controllers → Phase 3
- [DEFERRED] Integration tests → Pre-production
```

### Phase 1 Remaining Criteria (Already Met):
```
- [MET] p99 latencies ✅ (validated by both reviewers)
- [MET] Throughput ✅ (2.7M ops/sec achieved)
- [ONGOING] Documentation alignment (continuous)
- [DONE] Parallelization ✅ (11 Rayon workers)
- [DONE] Exchange simulator ✅ (complete with all features)
```

## Pre-Production Requirements (NEW)

### From Sophia (8 HIGH Priority):
1. **Bounded Idempotency**: LRU + time-wheel eviction
2. **STP Policies**: Self-trade prevention modes
3. **Decimal Arithmetic**: rust_decimal for money
4. **Error Taxonomy**: Complete venue errors
5. **Event Ordering**: Monotonic sequences
6. **P99.9 Gates**: Contention CI tests
7. **Backpressure**: Queue policies
8. **Supply Chain**: Security scanning

### From Nexus (3 Optimizations):
1. **MiMalloc Integration**: Already started, needs completion
2. **Object Pools**: 1M pre-allocation
3. **Historical Calibration**: Binance data fitting

**Timeline**: 3 weeks to production readiness

## What's Next in Pipeline

### Immediate Actions (Week 1):
1. **Close documentation gaps**:
   - Remove old/duplicate tasks from PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_MASTER.md
   - Update ARCHITECTURE.md with reviewer feedback
   - Create pre-production tracking document

2. **Begin pre-production work** (parallel to Phase 3):
   - Bounded idempotency (Morgan)
   - STP policies (Casey)
   - Decimal types (Quinn)
   - Error taxonomy (Sam)

3. **Start Phase 3 ML Integration**:
   - Feature engineering pipeline
   - Model versioning system
   - Real-time inference framework
   - Backtesting integration

### Phase 3 Preview:
**Owner**: Morgan (ML Lead)
**Duration**: 3 weeks estimated
**Key Components**:
- Feature store with 100+ indicators
- Model registry with A/B testing
- Sub-50ns inference
- AutoML pipeline
- Ensemble methods

---

## Critical Path Analysis

**Can Proceed to Phase 3**: YES ✅
- All Phase 0-2 features complete
- External validation received
- No blocking dependencies

**Cannot Deploy to Production**: NO ❌
- 11 pre-production requirements pending
- Need decimal arithmetic for financial accuracy
- Need bounded memory for stability
- Need STP for exchange compliance

---

## Recommendations

1. **Parallel Development**:
   - Track A: Phase 3 ML (Morgan leads)
   - Track B: Pre-production requirements (Alex coordinates)

2. **Priority Order**:
   - P1: Decimal types (financial accuracy)
   - P1: Bounded memory (stability)
   - P1: STP policies (compliance)
   - P2: Performance optimizations
   - P3: Historical calibration

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Sandbox environment in 2 weeks
   - Paper trading in 3 weeks
   - Production readiness in 4 weeks

---

## Team Assignments Summary

**Phase 3 ML Team**:
- Morgan (Lead): Feature engineering
- Avery: Data pipeline
- Jordan: Performance optimization

**Pre-Production Team**:
- Casey: STP + backpressure
- Sam: Error taxonomy
- Quinn: Decimal arithmetic
- Riley: Testing & validation
- Alex: Supply chain & coordination

---

## Conclusion

Phases 0-2 are **COMPLETE** with all core features implemented and validated by external reviewers. The system is architecturally sound and mathematically rigorous. 

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin Phase 3 ML Integration immediately
2. Complete pre-production requirements in parallel
3. Target sandbox deployment in 2 weeks
4. Production readiness in 3-4 weeks

The path forward is clear, with no blocking issues preventing Phase 3 development.
