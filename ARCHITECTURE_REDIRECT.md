# ‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION HAS MOVED

## üî¥ THIS FILE IS DEPRECATED

**The architecture documentation has been consolidated into a single source of truth:**

### üìç NEW LOCATION:
## `/home/hamster/bot4/docs/LLM_OPTIMIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md`

This is now the ONLY architecture document for the Bot4 project.

### Why the consolidation?
- We had 4+ competing architecture documents causing confusion
- Different documents had conflicting information
- Teams were updating different files
- No clear source of truth

### What's in the new document?
- Complete 7-Layer Architecture
- All component specifications
- Performance requirements and metrics
- Deduplication plan (158 duplicates identified!)
- Integration points and data flows
- Test coverage requirements
- 360-degree review process

### Archived Documents:
- `ARCHITECTURE_MASTER.md` ‚Üí Archived to `archived_docs/architecture_versions/`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` ‚Üí Archived to `archived_docs/architecture_versions/`
- `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_V3.md` ‚Üí Archived to `archived_docs/architecture_versions/`
