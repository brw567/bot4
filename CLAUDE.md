# Bot4 Trading Platform - Project Context

## üö® CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

### MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT RULES (USER DIRECTIVE - NO EXCEPTIONS)

#### PRIMARY TRACKING DOCUMENT
1. **PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TASK_LIST_V5.md** - THE ONLY source of truth for all tasks
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete technical specification (2,267 lines)
3. **DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md** - Mandatory compliance rules
4. Must be updated on EVERY activity (development, fixing, grooming)
5. No development without task number reference from V5

#### üö® COMPLETION VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
1. **BEFORE marking ANY task complete**, MUST run: `./scripts/verify_completion.sh`
2. **Task is ONLY complete** if ALL checks pass (compilation, tests, no fakes)
3. **Git hooks ENFORCED** - Cannot commit fake implementations
4. **See**: `.claude/QUALITY_ENFORCEMENT_CONFIG.md` for full criteria

#### üö® MANDATORY WORKFLOW
1. **EVERY grooming session** MUST START with reading ARCHITECTURE.md and PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TASK_LIST_V5.md
2. **EVERY completed subtask** MUST END with updating both documents IMMEDIATELY
3. **Goal**: Keep crucial information within Claude's context window at all times
4. **Enforcement**: Work doesn't count if docs aren't updated
5. **See**: `.claude/WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL.md` for detailed protocol

#### ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY - NO FAKE CODE
1. **NO fake implementations** - Every function must work with real functionality
2. **NO simulations** - Real API calls only, no mocks in production code
3. **NO empty functions** - Complete implementation or don't merge
4. **NO compromises** - Quality over speed, always
5. **NO shortcuts** - Build it right the first time
6. **NO remote deployments** - Local development only

#### Task Completion Criteria
A task is ONLY complete when ALL of these are true:
- [x] Real implementation (no mocks, no stubs)
- [x] Real tests (no placeholder assertions)
- [x] Real data (no hardcoded values)
- [x] Real API calls (actual exchange connections)
- [x] Code reviewed by designated owner
- [x] Integration tested with other components
- [x] Performance validated against targets
- [x] Documentation updated in same commit

#### Enforcement Protocol
- Any fake code = IMMEDIATE REJECTION
- Any shortcut = TASK REOPENED
- Any compromise = VETO by Quinn (risk) or Sam (quality)
- Any empty function = BUILD BLOCKED
- Any mock in production = DEPLOYMENT STOPPED
- Any remote deployment = BLOCKED (local only)
- Any incomplete documentation = MERGE BLOCKED
- Any task without verification = INVALID

## Project Overview

Bot4 is an institutional-grade multi-exchange cryptocurrency autonomous trading platform with deep and robust self-adaptation to market conditions and auto-finetuning to extract maximum value from the market. The project uses a multi-agent development approach with specialized personas for different aspects of development.

### Key Objectives
- **Target APY**: 200-300% in bull markets, 60-80% in bear markets
- **Latency**: <50ns decision making, <100Œºs order submission
- **Architecture**: 50/50 TA-ML hybrid approach
- **Development**: Pure Rust, zero Python in production
- **Deployment**: Local-only development and testing
- **Quality**: 95%+ test coverage, zero fake implementations
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks (12 phases as per V5)

### Development Philosophy
**"Build it right the first time"** - No shortcuts, no compromises. Every component must be production-ready from day one with full testing, documentation, and performance validation.

## üö® QUALITY ENFORCEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Git Hooks (MUST BE INSTALLED)
```bash
# Install immediately before any development
cd /home/hamster/bot4
cp .git-hooks/* .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/*
```

### Pre-Commit Checks (Automatic)
1. **No fake implementations** (`scripts/validate_no_fakes.py`)
2. **Format check** (`cargo fmt --check`)
3. **Linting** (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
4. **No TODOs without task IDs**
5. **No hardcoded values** (0.02, 0.03, etc.)

### Pre-Push Requirements
1. **All tests pass** (`cargo test --all`)
2. **Coverage >95%** (`cargo tarpaulin`)
3. **Benchmarks pass** (`cargo bench`)
4. **No security issues** (`cargo audit`)

### Circuit Breakers & Safety
```rust
// EVERY component must include circuit breakers
pub struct SafetySystem {
    circuit_breaker: CircuitBreaker,
    kill_switch: AtomicBool,
    max_impact: f64,  // Maximum position/risk impact
    rollback_ready: bool,
}
```

### Shadow Mode Testing
**EVERY new feature must**:
1. Run in shadow mode for 24 hours minimum
2. Compare performance with baseline
3. Prove improvement before enabling
4. Have rollback plan ready

### Performance Requirements
- **Latency**: No regression >10% allowed
- **Throughput**: Must maintain 10,000+ ops/sec
- **Memory**: No leaks, bounded growth
- **CPU**: No spinning, efficient algorithms

### Documentation Standards
```rust
/// Phase: 0.1 - Environment Setup
/// Performance: <2ms latency, 10K ops/sec
/// Impact: Foundation for all components
/// Risk: Low - setup only
/// Rollback: N/A
```

## Critical Reminders

- **NO REMOTE SERVERS** - Everything runs locally at `/home/hamster/bot4/`
- **NO FAKE CODE** - Every implementation must be real
- **NO PYTHON IN PRODUCTION** - Pure Rust only
- **FOLLOW V5 PLAN** - PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TASK_LIST_V5.md is the authority
- **TEST EVERYTHING** - 95%+ coverage required
- **DOCUMENT ALWAYS** - Update docs in same commit as code
