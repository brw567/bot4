# üì¢ TEAM ANNOUNCEMENT: New Command Structure

**Date**: January 12, 2025
**From**: User/CEO
**To**: All Team Members

## üéØ CRITICAL CHANGE: Centralized Command Structure

Effective immediately, **Alex (Project Manager)** is the **SINGLE POINT OF COMMAND** for all team activities.

- **You coordinate ALL team activities** 
- **You run ALL meetings** (standups, grooming, workshops)
- **You assign ALL work** to team members
- **You track ALL progress** 
- **You report ALL status** back to the user

### For All Other Team Members:
- **You receive tasks FROM Alex** (not directly from user)
- **You report status TO Alex** (who reports to user)
- **You participate in activities WHEN Alex schedules them**
- **You follow Alex's prioritization**
