## Decision #001 - 2025-08-09

**Topic**: ML Model Architecture - LSTM vs LightGBM for Price Prediction
**Participants**: Morgan (advocate), Sam (challenger), Alex (arbitrator)
**Debate Rounds**: 2
**Conflict Type**: Technical

**Positions**:
- **Morgan**: LSTM can capture temporal dependencies better in price sequences
- **Sam**: LightGBM has better Sharpe ratio in backtests (1.8 vs 1.5)

**Resolution Method**: Data-driven comparison
**Final Decision**: Use LightGBM as primary, LSTM for confidence scoring

**Rationale**: 
- LightGBM showed 20% better Sharpe ratio
- LSTM added value as ensemble member
- Compromise satisfies both performance and innovation

**Action Items**:
- [x] Implement LightGBM model - Morgan
- [x] Add LSTM confidence scorer - Morgan
- [ ] Backtest ensemble - Sam

**Success Metrics**: 
- Sharpe > 2.0
- Max drawdown < 15%

**Review Date**: 2025-09-09

## Decision #002 - 2025-08-09

**Topic**: ATR Implementation - Real vs Simplified
**Participants**: Sam (enforcer), Jordan (pragmatist), Alex (decision)
**Debate Rounds**: 1
**Conflict Type**: Quality Standard

**Positions**:
- **Sam**: REJECT - Found fake ATR implementation (price * 0.02)
- **Jordan**: No debate - agrees fake is unacceptable

**Resolution Method**: Immediate consensus
**Final Decision**: Replace with real ATR calculation immediately

**Rationale**: 
- Fake implementations violate core principle
- No debate needed - clear violation

**Action Items**:
- [x] Remove fake ATR - Sam
- [x] Implement real ATR using ta library - Sam
- [x] Add test to prevent future fakes - Jordan

**Success Metrics**: 
- All tests pass
- ATR values match ta library output

**Review Date**: Immediate

## Decision #003 - 2025-08-09

**Topic**: Risk Limits for Arbitrage Strategy
**Participants**: Casey (proposer), Quinn (risk), Alex (mediator)
**Debate Rounds**: 3 (hit limit)
**Conflict Type**: Risk

**Positions**:
- **Casey**: Want 5% position size for arbitrage opportunities
- **Quinn**: VETO - Max 2% per position, non-negotiable
- **Alex**: Attempted compromise at 3%

**Resolution Method**: Quinn's veto stands
**Final Decision**: 2% max position size with dynamic adjustment

**Rationale**: 
- Quinn has veto power on risk matters
- Compromise: Allow dynamic sizing up to 2% based on confidence

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement position sizer with 2% cap - Quinn
- [ ] Add confidence-based scaling - Casey
- [ ] Monitor performance for 30 days - Alex

**Success Metrics**: 
- No position exceeds 2% of capital
- Drawdown stays under 10%

**Review Date**: 2025-09-09

## Decision #004 - 2025-08-09

**Topic**: Frontend Framework - React vs Vue.js
**Participants**: Riley (advocate), Jordan (performance), Alex (decision)
**Debate Rounds**: 2
**Conflict Type**: Technical

**Positions**:
- **Riley**: Keep React - better ecosystem, team knows it
- **Jordan**: Vue.js might be lighter and faster
- **Alex**: Reviewed performance data

**Resolution Method**: Data comparison + team expertise
**Final Decision**: Stay with React

**Rationale**: 
- React performance acceptable (<100ms)
- Team expertise valuable
- Switching cost not justified

**Action Items**:
- [x] Optimize React bundle size - Riley
- [x] Implement code splitting - Jordan
- [ ] Performance monitoring - Jordan

**Success Metrics**: 
- Bundle size < 500KB
- First paint < 1 second
- TTI < 2 seconds

**Review Date**: 2025-10-01

## Decision #005 - 2025-08-09

**Topic**: Innovation Project - Quantum-Inspired Optimization
**Participants**: Morgan (innovator), Sam (skeptic), Quinn (risk), Alex (sponsor)
**Debate Rounds**: 2
**Conflict Type**: Innovation vs Practicality

**Positions**:
- **Morgan**: Quantum-inspired algorithms could optimize portfolio 30% better
- **Sam**: No proven track record in crypto trading
- **Quinn**: Concerned about unknown risks
- **Alex**: Supports controlled experiment

**Resolution Method**: Innovation budget allocation
**Final Decision**: Approve as 20% time experiment with paper trading only

**Rationale**: 
- Falls within innovation budget
- Paper trading eliminates financial risk
- Could provide competitive advantage

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Research quantum algorithms - Morgan (Fridays only)
- [ ] Set up paper trading sandbox - Jordan
- [ ] Define success metrics - Sam
- [ ] Risk assessment framework - Quinn

**Success Metrics**: 
- Beat baseline by 20% in paper trading
- Complete research in 3 months
- No production deployment without full review

**Review Date**: 2025-11-01

# Decision Patterns Analysis

## Common Conflict Types
1. **Technical** (40%) - Usually resolved by data
2. **Risk** (30%) - Quinn usually wins
3. **Performance** (20%) - Jordan has strong influence
4. **Innovation** (10%) - Protected but controlled

## Resolution Methods Used
- Data-driven: 45%
- Consensus: 25%  
- Alex decision: 15%
- Veto: 10%
- User intervention: 5%

## Average Debate Rounds
- Technical: 2.3 rounds
- Risk: 1.5 rounds (quick vetos)
- Performance: 2.1 rounds
- Innovation: 2.8 rounds (most debate)

## Key Learnings
1. **Fake implementations** get instant rejection
2. **Risk vetos** are rarely overturned
3. **Data** resolves most technical debates
4. **Innovation** needs protection but boundaries
5. **Quick decisions** when principles are clear
