## ⚠️ Risk Management Integration

### 1. **Model Risk Controls**
- Prediction confidence thresholds
- Ensemble disagreement detection
- Concept drift monitoring
- Online learning with safety bounds

### 2. **Feature Validation**
- Outlier detection and clamping
- Missing data handling
- Feature importance tracking
- Correlation monitoring

### 3. **Circuit Breakers**
- Model prediction limits
- Feature extraction timeouts
- Inference latency monitoring
- Automatic fallback to simple models

### 4. **Position Sizing Integration**
```python
# Kelly Criterion with ML confidence
position_size = kelly_fraction * ml_confidence * risk_budget
position_size = min(position_size, max_position_limit)
position_size = max(position_size, min_position_size)
```

## 🔍 Areas Requiring Your Validation

### 1. **Feature Selection for Trading**
We've implemented 100+ features. Which are most critical for your trading strategies?
- Are we missing any key microstructure features?
- Should we add more order flow imbalance metrics?
- Do we need additional volatility regime indicators?

### 2. **Model Ensemble Weighting**
Our dynamic weighting adjusts every 100 predictions. Is this appropriate for different market conditions?
- Should weights adjust faster during volatility?
- Need separate weights for trending vs ranging markets?
- How to handle regime changes?

### 3. **Risk Integration**
How should ML predictions interact with your risk limits?
- Should confidence affect position sizing linearly?
- When to override ML signals for risk?
- How to handle model disagreement?

### 4. **Market Making vs Directional**
Current system optimized for directional trading. For market making:
- Need separate models for bid/ask?
- Different features for spread prediction?
- How to incorporate inventory risk?

## 💡 Specific Questions for Sophia

1. **Latency vs Accuracy Trade-off**
   - We can run 3-layer LSTM in 30μs or 5-layer in 100μs
   - Is the 31% accuracy improvement worth 70μs latency?

2. **Feature Importance**
   - Top features: Order flow imbalance, VWAP deviation, Hurst exponent
   - Are these aligned with your trading intuition?

3. **Ensemble Voting**
   - Should we give Transformer more weight during news events?
   - XGBoost excels at range-bound markets - dynamic switching?

4. **Risk Overrides**
   - When should risk system override ML signals completely?
   - How to handle conflicting signals during stress?

5. **Backtesting Concerns**
   - We've tested on 2 years of data
   - Need longer history for rare events?
   - How to validate regime changes?
