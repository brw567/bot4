# Review Request for Sophia
## Date: 2025-08-16

Dear Sophia,

As our Architecture Auditor, please review the following items from today's standup:

### 1. Architecture Review Needed

**Component**: GlobalCircuitBreaker (TASK_1.1)
**Location**: /rust_core/crates/infrastructure/src/circuit_breaker.rs (to be created)

**Proposed Design**:
```rust
pub struct GlobalCircuitBreaker {
    breakers: Arc<DashMap<String, ComponentBreaker>>,
    global_state: Arc<RwLock<CircuitState>>,
    config: CircuitConfig,
}

pub enum CircuitState {
    Closed,      // Normal operation
    Open,        // Circuit tripped, rejecting calls  
    HalfOpen,    // Testing if service recovered
}
```

**Your Review Checklist**:
- [ ] No fake implementations (todo!(), unimplemented!())
- [ ] SOLID principles followed
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Thread safety guaranteed
- [ ] No hardcoded values

### 2. Code Quality Standards

Please confirm our standards are sufficient:
- 95% test coverage minimum
- No panics in production code
- All errors handled with Result<T, E>
- Memory safety guaranteed by Rust

### 3. Critical Question

**"Should we implement circuit breaker per-component or globally?"**

Global pros: Simpler, one source of truth
Component pros: Fine-grained control

Your architectural recommendation?
