## üéØ SPECIFIC REVIEW QUESTIONS

1. **Trading Logic**: Are our entry/exit rules sufficiently sophisticated for crypto markets?
2. **Risk Controls**: Do we have adequate protection against flash crashes and manipulation?
3. **ML Integration**: Is the ML signal weight (25%) appropriate for crypto trading?
4. **Latency vs Accuracy**: Have we struck the right balance for HFT?
5. **Market Regimes**: Is our regime detection robust enough for crypto volatility?
6. **Position Sizing**: Should we use Kelly Criterion or fixed fractional?
