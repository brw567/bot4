## üéØ Phase 4: Exchange Integration Plan

### Overview:
Phase 4 will implement production-ready exchange connectivity with advanced order management, smart routing, and real-time market data processing.

### Core Components:

#### 4.1 Exchange Connectors (Multi-Exchange Support)
```rust
pub trait ExchangeConnector: Send + Sync {
    // REST API
    async fn place_order(&self, order: Order) -> Result<OrderId>;
    async fn cancel_order(&self, id: OrderId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn get_balance(&self) -> Result<Balance>;
    
    // WebSocket streams
    async fn subscribe_orderbook(&self, symbol: &str) -> BoxStream<OrderBook>;
    async fn subscribe_trades(&self, symbol: &str) -> BoxStream<Trade>;
    async fn subscribe_user_data(&self) -> BoxStream<UserEvent>;
}
```

**Planned Exchanges**:
- Binance (primary)
- Kraken (secondary)
- Coinbase (tertiary)

#### 4.2 Smart Order Routing (SOR)
```yaml
features:
  - Best execution across exchanges
  - Liquidity aggregation
  - Latency-based routing
  - Fee optimization
  - Slippage minimization
  
algorithms:
  - TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
  - VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)
  - Iceberg orders
  - Sniper orders for arbitrage
```

#### 4.3 Market Data Management
```yaml
components:
  orderbook_aggregator:
    - Multi-exchange depth consolidation
    - Real-time arbitrage detection
    - Imbalance calculations

    - Volume profile building
    - Whale detection
    
  latency_monitor:
    - Exchange response times
    - WebSocket heartbeat tracking
    - Automatic reconnection
```

#### 4.4 Order Lifecycle Management
```yaml
states:
  - PENDING: Order created locally
  - SUBMITTED: Sent to exchange
  - ACKNOWLEDGED: Exchange confirmed
  - PARTIALLY_FILLED: Partial execution
  - FILLED: Complete execution
  - CANCELLED: User/system cancelled
  - REJECTED: Exchange rejected
  - EXPIRED: Time limit reached

features:
  - Automatic retry on transient failures
  - Order modification support
  - Fill tracking with fee calculation
  - Position reconciliation
```

#### 4.5 Risk Controls for Live Trading
```yaml
pre_trade_checks:
  - Position limits
  - Leverage constraints
  - Margin requirements
  - Correlation limits
  
real_time_monitoring:
  - P&L tracking
  - Drawdown alerts
  - Exposure monitoring
  - Greeks calculation (for options)
  
emergency_controls:
  - Kill switch (cancel all orders)
  - Reduce-only mode
  - Liquidation prevention
  - Circuit breakers
```

## üîç Review Questions for Sophia

### 1. Exchange Selection & Priority
Given our capital tiers ($1K-$10M), which exchanges would you prioritize for:
- Low capital ($1-5K): Best for small traders?
- Medium capital ($5-100K): Optimal liquidity?
- High capital ($100K+): Institutional features?

### 2. Order Execution Strategy
For our smart order routing, what weightings would you suggest for:
- Price improvement vs execution speed?
- Maker vs taker orders?
- Hidden liquidity sources?

### 3. Market Making vs Taking
Should we implement market-making capabilities in Phase 4, or focus purely on taking liquidity? Consider:
- Exchange rebates
- Inventory risk
- Competition from HFT firms

### 4. Risk Management Priorities
What are the most critical risk controls for live trading? Rank these:
1. Maximum position size
2. Daily loss limits
3. Correlation limits
4. Leverage constraints
5. Volatility-based position sizing

### 5. Latency Requirements
Our current latency targets:
- Order submission: <100Œºs
- Market data processing: <50Œºs
- Risk checks: <10Œºs

Are these sufficient for:
- Arbitrage strategies?
- Market making?
- Trend following?

### 6. Advanced Order Types
Beyond OCO orders, which should we prioritize:
- Trailing stops
- Iceberg orders
- Time-weighted orders
- Adaptive orders (adjust to market conditions)

### 7. Market Microstructure Considerations
How should we handle:
- Exchange outages
- Flash crashes
- Coordinated pump & dumps
- Wash trading detection

### 8. Regulatory Compliance
What compliance features are essential:
- Trade reporting
- Audit trails
- KYC/AML integration
- Tax reporting
