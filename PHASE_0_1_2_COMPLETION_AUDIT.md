5. **Exchange Simulator** ✅ (1872+ lines)
6. **Idempotency Manager** ✅
7. **OCO Orders** ✅
8. **Fee Model** ✅
9. **Property Tests** ✅

#### ❌ INCOMPLETE (Pre-Production Requirements from Reviews):

**From Sophia's Review (8 items pending):**

- [ ] **STP Policies**: Cancel-new/cancel-resting/decrement-both
- [ ] **Decimal Arithmetic**: rust_decimal for all money operations

- [ ] **Event Ordering**: Monotonic sequence guarantees
- [ ] **P99.9 Gates**: Contention tests with CI artifacts
- [ ] **Backpressure**: Explicit queue policies
- [ ] **Supply Chain**: Vault/KMS + SBOM + cargo audit

**From Nexus's Review (3 items pending):**
- [ ] **MiMalloc Integration**: Global allocator upgrade (NOTE: Conflicts with Phase 0 completion?)
- [ ] **Object Pools**: 1M pre-allocated orders/ticks (NOTE: Partial in Phase 0?)
- [ ] **Historical Calibration**: Fit to real Binance data

**Week 2 Items (6 items pending):**
- [ ] Statistical distributions (Poisson/Beta/LogNormal)
- [ ] Timestamp validation
- [ ] Validation filters
- [ ] PostgreSQL repository implementation (NOTE: We created the file but not fully integrated)
- [ ] REST API controllers
- [ ] Integration tests

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. CONFLICTING INFORMATION
**Issue**: MiMalloc and Object Pools marked complete in Phase 0 but pending in Phase 2
- Phase 0 claims: "MiMalloc global allocator (<10ns achieved) ✅"
- Phase 2 pre-production: "MiMalloc Integration: Global allocator upgrade [ ]"

**Jordan**: "We have basic MiMalloc but Nexus wants the full integration with 1M pre-allocated pools"

### 2. REPOSITORY PATTERN CONFUSION
**Issue**: Repository pattern marked complete today but PostgreSQL implementation pending
- We created: `/rust_core/adapters/outbound/persistence/postgres_order_repository.rs`
- Still pending: Full PostgreSQL integration and testing

**Avery**: "The pattern is implemented but not connected to real database yet"

### 3. PHASE 3 LISTED AS COMPLETE
**Issue**: Phase 3 (ML Integration) marked 100% complete but dated future (2025-08-18)
- This appears to be an error as today is 2025-01-18

**Morgan**: "Phase 3 is NOT complete - this is a documentation error"

## 🔴 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Phase 2 Completion (17 items)
**Owner**: Casey & Sam
**Timeline**: 1 week

#### High Priority (affects trading):
1. Decimal Arithmetic - **Quinn**
2. Event Ordering - **Sam**
3. PostgreSQL repository integration - **Avery**
4. Statistical distributions - **Morgan**

#### Medium Priority (production readiness):
5. Bounded Idempotency - **Casey**
6. STP Policies - **Casey**
7. Error Taxonomy - **Sam**
8. P99.9 Gates - **Jordan**
9. Backpressure - **Riley**
10. REST API controllers - **Sam**

#### Lower Priority (can be parallel):
11. Supply Chain Security - **Alex**

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION CORRECTIONS NEEDED

1. **Fix Phase 3 status**: Change from "100% COMPLETE" to "0% - NOT STARTED"
2. **Clarify MiMalloc status**: Document what's done vs what Nexus wants
3. **Update Phase 2 status**: Change from "100%" to "85%"
4. **Fix dates**: Phase 3 completion date is in the future

## 👥 TEAM CONSENSUS

**Alex**: "We have 17 items to complete Phase 2 properly. Can we commit to 1 week?"

**Casey**: "I can handle the exchange-related items in 3 days"

**Sam**: "Event ordering and REST controllers - 2 days"

**Quinn**: "Decimal arithmetic is critical - 1 day"

**Morgan**: "Statistical distributions - 2 days"

**Avery**: "PostgreSQL integration - 2 days"

**Jordan**: "Full MiMalloc and pools - 3 days"
