## üîç EXAMPLE: Order Struct Consolidation

### Round 1: Discovery (All agents analyze together)

**AVERY**: "Found 44 Order structs across 12 modules"
**BLAKE**: "ML module uses 3 variants with different features"
**CAMERON**: "Risk module has 5 versions with different fields"
**DREW**: "Exchange integration has 8 exchange-specific versions"
**ELLIS**: "Total memory overhead: 127MB from duplicates"
**MORGAN**: "Only 23% have test coverage"
**QUINN**: "17 integration points affected"
**SKYLER**: "Audit shows 6 versions missing safety checks"
**KARL**: "This is our highest priority - affects everything"

### Round 2: Collaborative Design

```rust
// After 9-way discussion, agreed canonical structure:
pub struct Order {
    // Core fields (all agents agreed)
    pub id: OrderId,
    pub symbol: Symbol,
    pub side: OrderSide,
    pub quantity: Quantity,
    pub order_type: OrderType,
    
    // Risk fields (Cameron's requirements)
    pub max_slippage: Decimal,
    pub risk_limit: Decimal,
    pub kelly_fraction: Decimal,
    
    // ML fields (Blake's requirements)
    pub ml_confidence: f64,
    pub feature_vector: Option<Vec<f64>>,
    pub model_version: String,
    
    // Exchange fields (Drew's requirements)
    pub exchange: Exchange,
    pub client_order_id: String,
    pub time_in_force: TimeInForce,
    
    // Safety fields (Skyler's requirements)
    pub kill_switch_enabled: bool,
    pub audit_trail: AuditTrail,
    pub compliance_checks: ComplianceStatus,
    
    // Performance fields (Ellis's requirements)
    pub creation_time_ns: u64,
    pub last_update_ns: u64,
    
    // Metadata (Karl's requirements)
    pub created_by: AgentId,
    pub approval_votes: Vec<AgentVote>,
}
```

### Round 3: Implementation Review

**ALL AGENTS REVIEWING IN REAL-TIME**:
- Line 7: Cameron: "Add validation for kelly_fraction <= 0.25"
- Line 12: Blake: "Feature vector should be Box<[f64]> for performance"
- Line 18: Drew: "Need exchange-specific extensions trait"
- Line 23: Skyler: "Kill switch must be atomic bool"
- Line 28: Ellis: "Use TSC counter for nanosecond precision"
- Line 32: Morgan: "Add builder pattern for testing"
- Line 34: Quinn: "Implement From traits for all old versions"
- Line 36: Avery: "Add phantom data for compile-time checking"
- Line 38: Karl: "Document migration timeline"

### Round 4: Validation (All agents test together)

**Test Coverage by Agent**:
- Morgan: Unit tests (100% coverage)
- Quinn: Integration tests (all 17 points)
- Cameron: Risk limit tests
- Blake: ML feature tests
- Drew: Exchange compatibility tests
- Ellis: Performance benchmarks (<10ns creation)
- Skyler: Safety validation tests
- Avery: Architecture compliance tests
- Karl: Documentation completeness

### Round 5: Consensus & Deployment

**FINAL VOTE** (must be unanimous for core types):
- ‚úÖ Karl: "Approved - meets all requirements"
- ‚úÖ Avery: "Architecture sound"
- ‚úÖ Blake: "ML requirements satisfied"
- ‚úÖ Cameron: "Risk controls adequate"
- ‚úÖ Drew: "Exchange compatible"
- ‚úÖ Ellis: "Performance optimal"
- ‚úÖ Morgan: "Fully tested"
- ‚úÖ Quinn: "Integration verified"
- ‚úÖ Skyler: "Safety confirmed"

**Result**: 9/9 APPROVED - DEPLOY

## ‚è±Ô∏è REVISED TIMELINE

With sequential collaboration:

| Phase | Hours | Duplicates Eliminated |
|-------|-------|----------------------|
| Week 1 | 60 | Order, Position, Trade structs |
| Week 2 | 60 | WebSocket, Risk functions |
| Week 3 | 60 | ML features, Indicators |
| Week 4 | 60 | Remaining duplicates |
| **Total** | **240** | **166 ‚Üí 0** |

**Note**: Sequential takes longer (240 vs 160 hours) but ensures PERFECT implementation.
