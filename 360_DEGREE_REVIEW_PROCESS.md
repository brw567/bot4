## 📊 Review Process

### Step 1: Review Initiation
```yaml
initiator: Task owner
method: Create review document
timeline: Within 2 hours of checkpoint
content:
  - Task description
  - Implementation approach
  - Code/design artifacts
  - Test results
  - Performance metrics
```

### Step 2: Team Review (Parallel)
```yaml
duration: 4-8 hours
process:
  - Each member reviews independently
  - Documents findings in review doc
  - Assigns severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Provides specific feedback
format:
  reviewer: [Name]
  status: [Approved/Conditional/Rejected]
  findings:
    - critical: [List critical issues]
    - improvements: [Suggested improvements]
    - questions: [Clarifications needed]
```

### Step 3: Consensus Building
```yaml
facilitator: Alex (or Morgan for ML tasks)
timeline: Within 24 hours
process:
  - Address all critical issues
  - Resolve conflicts
  - Document decisions
  - Update implementation
outcome:
  - Unanimous approval (proceed)
  - Conditional approval (fix then proceed)
  - Rejection (redesign required)
```

### Step 4: Documentation Update
```yaml
responsible: Task owner + Alex
documents_to_update:
  - PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_MASTER.md
  - ARCHITECTURE.md
  - PHASE_*_REPORTS.md
  - Task-specific docs
  - Review logs
timeline: Before moving to next task
```
