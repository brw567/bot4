## ðŸ“‹ Action Plan for Non-Blocking Items

### 1. Coverage & Security Gates (MEDIUM Priority)
**Deadline: Before first Phase-1 merge**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml additions
coverage:
  enforce:
    line: "â‰¥95%"
    branch: "â‰¥90%"
    critical_crates: ["trading_engine", "risk", "infrastructure"]
  
security:
    - cargo clippy -- -D warnings
    - cargo audit --deny warnings
    - cargo deny check
    - upload flamegraphs as artifacts
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install cargo-tarpaulin for coverage
- [ ] Add cargo-audit to CI pipeline
- [ ] Configure cargo-deny for supply chain
- [ ] Generate and upload flamegraphs

### 2. SLO Burn-Rate Alerts (LOW Priority)
**Deadline: First Phase-1 PR**

```rust
// New recording rules
record: slo_burn_rate_1m
expr: |
  rate(errors_total[1m]) / rate(requests_total[1m])

record: queue_depth_pressure
expr: |
  (queue_items / queue_capacity) * 100

// New alerts
- alert: SLOBurnRateHigh
  expr: slo_burn_rate_1m > 0.001  # 0.1% error budget burn
  for: 1m
  
- alert: QueueBackpressure
  expr: queue_depth_pressure > 80
  for: 30s
  
- alert: CircuitBreakerFlapping
  expr: rate(circuit_breaker_state_changes[5m]) > 10
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create SLO burn-rate dashboard
- [ ] Add queue depth monitoring
- [ ] Implement breaker flapping detection
- [ ] Configure AlertManager escalation

### 3. Secrets & Supply Chain (LOW Priority)
**Deadline: During early Phase-1**

```toml
# cargo-deny.toml
[advisories]
vulnerability = "deny"
unmaintained = "warn"
yanked = "deny"

[licenses]
copyleft = "deny"
allow = ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause"]

[sources]
unknown-registry = "deny"
unknown-git = "deny"
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Integrate HashiCorp Vault or AWS KMS
- [ ] Generate SBOM with cargo-sbom
- [ ] Pin Rust toolchain version
- [ ] Setup reproducible builds
- [ ] Container image scanning

### 4. Portability Contracts (LOW Priority)
**Deadline: Early Phase-1**

```rust
// Atomic validation
#[cfg(not(target_has_atomic = "64"))]
compile_error!("Bot4 requires 64-bit atomics");

// SIMD with fallback
pub fn correlation_matrix(data: &[f64]) -> Matrix {
    #[cfg(target_feature = "avx2")]
    {
        return correlation_avx2(data);
    }
    
    #[cfg(target_feature = "neon")]
    {
        return correlation_neon(data);
    }
    
    // Scalar fallback
    correlation_scalar(data)
}

// Runtime detection
fn initialize_simd() {
    if is_x86_feature_detected!("avx2") {
        log::info!("AVX2 acceleration enabled");
    } else {
        log::warn!("Using scalar fallback - performance degraded");
    }
}
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add compile-time atomic checks
- [ ] Implement SIMD with scalar fallback
- [ ] Runtime CPU feature detection
- [ ] Benchmark SIMD vs scalar paths

### 5. Runbooks & Chaos Drills (LOW Priority)
**Deadline: By mid Phase-1**

```markdown
## Runbook: Circuit Breaker Flapping
1. Check error rate: `cb_error_rate{component="*"}`
2. Verify thresholds: Should be 50% open, 35% close
3. Check min_samples: Must be â‰¥10
4. Increase hysteresis gap if needed
5. Page on-call if >5 flaps/minute

## Runbook: Queue Overflow
1. Check depth: `queue_depth_percent{queue="*"}`
2. Identify bottleneck component
3. Scale consumers or apply backpressure
4. Emergency drain if >95% for >1min

## Chaos Drill Schedule
- Monthly: Network partition (5s recovery target)
- Weekly: Component failure injection
- Daily: Load spike simulation (10x normal)
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write 10 critical runbooks
- [ ] Schedule monthly game days
- [ ] Implement chaos monkey
- [ ] Create incident response templates

## ðŸŽ¯ Sophia's Prioritization - Our Execution Plan

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Exchange Simulator** (per Sophia's recommendation)
   ```rust
   pub struct ExchangeSimulator {
       rate_limiter: TokenBucket,
       partial_fills: bool,
       cancel_probability: f64,
       outage_simulator: OutagePattern,
       latency_model: LatencyDistribution,
   }
   ```

2. **Emotion-Free Trading Gate**
   ```rust
   pub struct EmotionFreeGate {
       enabled: AtomicBool,
       audit_log: AuditLogger,
       metrics: GateMetrics,
       override_key: Option<SecureKey>,
   }
   ```

### Next Sprint
3. **Coverage/Security CI Gates**
4. **SLO Burn-Rate Monitoring**

### Following Sprint  
5. **Secrets Management & SBOM**
6. **Portability Guards**
7. **Runbooks & Chaos Drills**

## ðŸ’¬ Responses to Sophia's Answers

### Q1: TLS-backed pools (128-item caches)
**Sophia**: "Yesâ€”meets expectations. Keep caches tunable"

**Action**: Making cache size configurable via environment variable:
```rust
const TLS_CACHE_SIZE: usize = 
    env::var("BOT4_TLS_CACHE_SIZE")
        .unwrap_or("128".to_string())
        .parse()
        .unwrap_or(128);
```

### Q2: Three Grafana dashboards sufficient?
**Sophia**: "Sufficient to start. Add SLO burn-rate + queue-depth"

**Action**: Creating two additional dashboards next sprint
- SLO Burn-Rate Dashboard
- Queue Pressure Dashboard

### Q3: Prioritize next?
**Sophia**: "Exchange simulator first, Rayon after E2E validated"

**Action**: Exchange simulator is now top priority for Phase 1

### Q4: Emotion-free trading gate now?
**Sophia**: "Yesâ€”before Phase-1 live routing"

**Action**: Implementing this week with audit logging

## Team Commitment

Sophia, thank you for the thorough review and 92/100 score. We commit to:

1. **Implementing all 5 non-blocking items** per your deadlines
2. **Prioritizing exchange simulator** as our first Phase 1 deliverable
3. **Adding emotion-free trading gate** before any live routing
4. **Maintaining zero-fake policy** throughout development
5. **Keeping global-fuse hysteresis** as recommended

Your feedback on hardcoded IPs ("Team, are you serious?") led to immediate improvements. This pragmatic review approach helps us build better software.

We're starting Phase 1 immediately with exchange simulator development.
