## 🎯 Goals

1. **Zero-Overhead Metrics**: Lock-free metric collection
2. **<1μs Recording**: Atomic counter updates
3. **Multi-Format Export**: Prometheus, StatsD, JSON
4. **Real-Time Dashboards**: WebSocket streaming
5. **Alerting System**: Threshold-based alerts

## 👥 Team Perspectives

### Alex (Team Lead)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Can't optimize what we can't measure
**Requirements**:

### Sam (Quant Developer)
**Trading Metrics**:
- Strategy performance (Sharpe, Sortino)
- Order fill rates and slippage
- Market microstructure metrics
- Indicator values and signals

**Innovation**: Implement custom trading metrics like "edge decay" and "alpha generation rate".

### Jordan (DevOps)
**Infrastructure Metrics**:
- CPU/Memory/Network usage
- I/O latency and throughput
- Connection pool statistics
- Cache hit rates

**Critical**: Must support Prometheus scraping and Grafana dashboards. Need 1-minute retention for 7 days.

### Casey (Exchange Specialist)
**Exchange Metrics**:
- WebSocket latency per exchange
- Order routing distribution
- Rate limit usage
- API error rates

**Requirement**: Per-exchange breakdown for all metrics to identify best venues.

### Quinn (Risk Manager)
**Risk Metrics** (CRITICAL):
- Position exposure in real-time
- Drawdown tracking
- VaR and CVaR
- Correlation matrices
- Stop-loss triggers

**MANDATE**: Risk metrics must be updated within 1ms of any position change. No exceptions.

### Riley (Frontend/Testing)
**Dashboard Requirements**:
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Historical charts
- Alert notifications
- Mobile-responsive

**Test Coverage**: Load test with 10,000 metrics/second, verify zero data loss.

### Avery (Data Engineer)
**Data Pipeline Metrics**:
- Data ingestion rates
- Processing latency
- Queue depths
- Error rates

**Storage**: Time-series optimization with downsampling for long-term storage.

## 🏗️ Technical Design

### 1. Core Metrics System

```rust
pub struct MetricsSystem {
    // Lock-free collectors
    counters: Arc<DashMap<String, AtomicU64>>,
    gauges: Arc<DashMap<String, AtomicF64>>,
    histograms: Arc<DashMap<String, Histogram>>,
    
    // Export targets
    prometheus: PrometheusExporter,
    statsd: StatsDExporter,
    websocket: WebSocketExporter,
    
    // Alerting
    alert_manager: AlertManager,
}
```

### 2. Metric Categories

**Trading Metrics** (1ms update):
- P&L (realized/unrealized)
- Win rate and profit factor
- Average trade duration
- Slippage and fees

**Performance Metrics** (100μs update):
- Strategy evaluation latency
- Order submission time
- Event processing rate
- Cache performance

**Risk Metrics** (Real-time):
- Exposure by symbol/exchange
- Maximum drawdown
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Correlation tracking

**System Metrics** (1s update):
- CPU and memory usage
- Network I/O
- Disk usage
- Thread pool statistics

### 3. Export Formats

**Prometheus** (Pull model):
- HTTP endpoint on :9090/metrics
- Custom collectors for trading
- Histogram buckets optimized for μs

**StatsD** (Push model):
- UDP packets for low overhead
- Aggregation at source
- Sample rates for high-volume

**WebSocket** (Stream model):
- Real-time metric updates
- Filtered subscriptions
- Binary protocol for efficiency

## 💡 Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Predictive Monitoring
- ML model for anomaly detection
- Predict system failures before they happen
