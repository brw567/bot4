# Grooming Session: Retry System with Exponential Backoff

**Date**: 2025-01-10
**Participants**: All Team Members
**Priority**: P1 - High (System Resilience)

## 📋 Overview

We need to implement a comprehensive retry system with exponential backoff to handle transient failures across all system components. This will significantly improve system resilience and reduce manual intervention.

## 👥 Team Discussion

### Alex (Team Lead) - Strategic View
"This is critical for production stability. We need a retry system that's:
1. **Configurable** - Different strategies for different operations
2. **Observable** - Full metrics and logging
3. **Integrated** - Works with our circuit breakers
4. **Smart** - Knows when NOT to retry
5. **Production-ready** - Battle-tested patterns"

### Jordan (DevOps) - Infrastructure Requirements
"Key performance requirements:
- **No blocking** - All retries must be async
- **Jitter** - Prevent thundering herd
- **Resource limits** - Cap concurrent retries
- **Metrics** - Track retry rates, success rates
- **Integration** - Work with health checks and circuit breakers
- **Latency impact** - Must not exceed 100ms p99"

### Quinn (Risk Manager) - Risk Considerations
"Critical risk controls needed:
- **Order operations** - NEVER retry orders that might duplicate
- **Idempotency** - Ensure operations are safe to retry
- **Cost limits** - Cap retry attempts for expensive operations
- **State validation** - Check system state before retry
- **Audit trail** - Log all retry attempts
- **Manual override** - Emergency stop mechanism"

### Casey (Exchange Specialist) - Exchange Integration
"Exchange-specific requirements:
- **Rate limiting aware** - Back off on 429 responses
- **Exchange-specific delays** - Different exchanges have different limits
- **Order status checks** - Verify order state before retry
- **WebSocket reconnection** - Smart reconnection strategy
- **Market data gaps** - Handle missing data during outages"

### Morgan (ML Specialist) - ML Considerations
"ML-specific needs:
- **Model inference retries** - Handle temporary model unavailability
- **Feature fetch retries** - Robust feature data retrieval
- **Training job retries** - Resume from checkpoints
- **Prediction caching** - Use cached predictions during outages
- **Degraded mode** - Fall back to simpler models"

### Sam (Code Quality) - Implementation Standards
"Code quality requirements:
- **No fake implementations** - Real exponential backoff math
- **Type safety** - Full type hints
- **Decorator pattern** - Easy to apply to any function
- **Context managers** - For scoped retry policies
- **Comprehensive tests** - Cover all edge cases"

### Riley (Testing) - Test Requirements
"Testing needs:
- **100% coverage** - All retry scenarios
- **Failure injection** - Test transient vs permanent failures
- **Performance tests** - Verify no blocking
- **Integration tests** - With circuit breakers
- **Chaos testing** - Random failure patterns"

### Avery (Data Engineer) - Data Integrity
"Data considerations:
- **Transaction safety** - Don't retry partial transactions
- **Write idempotency** - Prevent duplicate writes
- **Read consistency** - Handle stale reads during retries
- **Batch processing** - Retry failed batch items individually
- **Data validation** - Verify data integrity after retries"

## 🎯 Requirements
