# Grooming Session: Task 8.3.1 - Risk-Adjusted Signal Weighting

**Date**: 2025-01-11
**Task**: 8.3.1 - Risk-Adjusted Signal Weighting
**Epic**: ALT1 Enhancement Layers (Week 3)
**Estimated Effort**: 12 hours

## Overview

Implement dynamic signal weighting based on risk metrics, market conditions, and historical performance. This system will optimize signal strength based on multiple risk factors to improve risk-adjusted returns.

## Team Discussion

### Alex (Team Lead)
"Week 3 begins! We need to integrate risk metrics directly into signal generation. Every signal should be weighted by its risk profile."

### Quinn (Risk Manager) 
"Finally! This is critical. We need dynamic position sizing based on:
- Current drawdown levels
- Correlation risk
- Market volatility
- Liquidity conditions
- Time of day risk"

### Morgan (ML Specialist)
"I can add ML-based risk prediction. We should predict:
- Probability of stop-loss hit
- Expected maximum adverse excursion
- Optimal holding period
- Risk-adjusted profit targets"

### Sam (Quant Developer)
"The weighting formula needs to be mathematically sound:
- Kelly Criterion for optimal sizing
- Sharpe ratio optimization
- Maximum drawdown constraints
- Risk parity across strategies"

### Jordan (Performance)
"Keep calculations fast:
- Pre-compute risk metrics
- Cache historical performance
- SIMD for vector operations
- Lock-free risk updates"

## Enhancement Opportunities Identified

### 1. **Dynamic Kelly Criterion** 
- Adaptive bet sizing based on win rate and edge

- Fractional Kelly for safety (25% of full Kelly)

### 2. **Volatility-Scaled Positions**
- ATR-based position sizing
- GARCH volatility forecasting
- Regime-specific volatility adjustments
- Intraday vs overnight volatility

### 3. **Drawdown-Based Reduction**

- Recovery mode after large losses
- Equity curve trading rules
- Underwater equity protection

### 4. **Correlation-Weighted Allocation**
- Reduce size for correlated positions
- Portfolio heat mapping
- Dynamic correlation windows
- Cross-strategy correlation

### 5. **Time-Decay Weighting**
- Signal strength decay over time
- Optimal entry window tracking
- Stale signal detection
- Time-zone based adjustments

### 6. **Liquidity-Adjusted Sizing**
- Order book depth analysis
- Slippage estimation
- Market impact modeling
- Smart order splitting

### 7. **Performance-Based Weighting**
- Track signal source performance
- Adaptive confidence scores
- Strategy rotation based on recent performance
- Mean reversion in strategy performance

### 8. **Risk Budget Allocation**
- Daily/weekly/monthly risk budgets
- VaR-based allocation
- Tail risk reserves
- Emergency risk reduction

### 9. **Multi-Factor Risk Model**
- Combine all risk factors
- Non-linear risk interactions
- Machine learning risk prediction
- Explainable risk scores

### 10. **Real-Time Risk Dashboard**
- Visual risk heat map
- Risk utilization gauges
- Alert system for risk breaches
- Historical risk analysis

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
pub struct RiskAdjustedSignalWeighting {
    kelly_calculator: DynamicKellyCriterion,
    volatility_scaler: VolatilityScaling,
    drawdown_manager: DrawdownBasedReduction,
    correlation_weight: CorrelationWeighting,
    time_decay: TimeDecayModel,
    liquidity_adjuster: LiquidityAdjustment,
    performance_tracker: PerformanceWeighting,
    risk_budget: RiskBudgetAllocator,
    multi_factor: MultiFactorRiskModel,
    risk_dashboard: RealTimeRiskDashboard,
}
```

### Risk Calculation Pipeline
1. **Signal Reception** → Base signal strength
2. **Risk Assessment** → Calculate all risk metrics
3. **Weight Calculation** → Apply risk adjustments
4. **Position Sizing** → Convert to position size
5. **Risk Validation** → Final risk checks
6. **Execution** → Send adjusted order
