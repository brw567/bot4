## Team Consensus & Decisions

### Alex (Strategic Architect) âœ…
"Implement top 6 enhancements. Multi-source aggregation and whale tracking are game-changers. This gives us institutional-grade sentiment analysis."

### Morgan (ML Specialist) âœ…
"The NLP pipeline with sarcasm detection will filter out 90% of noise. Combined with influencer scoring, we'll have the cleanest sentiment signal in crypto."

### Sam (Quant Developer) âœ…
"Real-time processing in Rust is non-negotiable. We need <100ms from tweet to signal. I'll optimize with SIMD."

### Quinn (Risk Manager) âœ…
"Fear & Greed 2.0 is essential for position sizing. Add liquidation cascades and funding rates for complete picture."

### Casey (Exchange Specialist) âœ…
"Whale wallet tracking is huge. We can see accumulation patterns 30-60 minutes before price moves."

### Jordan (DevOps) âœ…
"Can handle 10K messages/sec with proper architecture. Need Redis for caching and rate limit management."

### Riley (Frontend) âœ…
"Sentiment dashboard will show heat maps and influencer rankings. Users will love this transparency."

### Avery (Data Engineer) âœ…
"Multi-source pipeline ready. Can aggregate all APIs with fallback redundancy."
