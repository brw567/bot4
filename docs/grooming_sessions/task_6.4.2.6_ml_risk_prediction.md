# Grooming Session: Task 6.4.2.6 - ML Risk Prediction

**Date**: 2025-01-11
**Task**: 6.4.2.6 - ML Risk Prediction
**Parent**: 6.4.2 - Risk Engine Rust Migration
**Epic**: 6 - Emotion-Free Maximum Profitability
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Predict risk before it materializes!

## 📋 Task Overview

Implement ML-based risk prediction that forecasts drawdowns, correlation spikes, and volatility regimes 5-10 minutes ahead. This is our CRYSTAL BALL - seeing risk before it happens.

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Drawdown Prediction**: Forecast potential drawdowns with 75%+ accuracy
2. **Correlation Forecasting**: LSTM for correlation spike detection
3. **Volatility Clustering**: GARCH models in Rust
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Catch unusual risk patterns instantly
5. **Risk Scoring**: Real-time risk score for every position

## 👥 Team Perspectives

### Morgan (ML Specialist) - LEAD FOR THIS TASK
**ML Architecture**:
- LSTM for time-series risk prediction
- Ensemble of XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks
- Online learning for adaptive risk models
- Feature engineering from 100+ market indicators

**Innovation**: Use attention mechanisms to focus on risk-relevant features!

### Quinn (Risk Manager)
**Integration Requirements**:
- Must integrate seamlessly with atomic risk limits
- Predictions must trigger preemptive actions
- False positives must be <5%
- Model confidence scores required

**Critical**: "A prediction is only useful if we can act on it in time."

### Sam (Quant Developer)
**Mathematical Models**:
- GARCH for volatility prediction
- Copulas for tail dependency
- Extreme Value Theory for black swans
- Regime-switching models

**Enhancement**: Implement fast GARCH using Rust for real-time updates.

### Jordan (DevOps)
**Performance Requirements**:
- Inference <10ms for all models
- Model updates without restart
- GPU acceleration optional
- Memory-bounded predictions

**Optimization**: Use model quantization for 4x speed with <1% accuracy loss.
