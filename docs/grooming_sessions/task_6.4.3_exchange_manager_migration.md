## 🏗️ Technical Design

### 1. Core Exchange Manager Structure

    exchanges: Arc<DashMap<ExchangeId, ExchangeConnection>>,
    
    // Order books
    order_books: Arc<LockFreeOrderBooks>,
    
    // Order routing
    smart_router: Arc<SmartOrderRouter>,
    
    // Rate limiting
    rate_limiters: Arc<RateLimitManager>,

```rust
pub struct ExchangeConnection {
    // QUIC or WebSocket connection
    connection: QuicStream / WebSocketStream,
    
    // Zero-copy parser
    parser: ZeroCopyParser,
    
    // Message handlers
    handlers: MessageHandlers,
    
    // Reconnection logic
    reconnector: ExponentialBackoff,
}
```

### 3. Lock-Free Order Book

```rust
pub struct LockFreeOrderBook {
    // Bids and asks in lock-free structures
    bids: Arc<SkipList<Price, Order>>,
    asks: Arc<SkipList<Price, Order>>,
    
    // Atomic best bid/ask
    best_bid: AtomicF64,
    best_ask: AtomicF64,
    
    // Version for consistency
    version: AtomicU64,
}
```
