# Grooming Session: Health Check Aggregator

## Date: 2025-01-10
## Participants: All Team Members

---

## Overview
Create a comprehensive health check aggregator that consolidates health status from all system components, providing a unified view of system health.

## Team Discussion

### Alex (Team Lead):
"We need a centralized health monitoring system that aggregates checks from all components. This is critical for production readiness and aligns with Jordan's uptime requirements."

### Jordan (DevOps):
"The aggregator must be performant - health checks shouldn't impact system performance. I need:
- Parallel health checking
- Caching of results (5-second TTL)
- Circuit breaker for failing health checks
- Prometheus metrics export
- Response time < 100ms for aggregated health"

### Quinn (Risk Manager):
"Health checks must include risk system validation:
- Position limits are enforced
- Stop-loss systems are active
- Circuit breakers are operational
- Risk engine is responsive
- All safety systems are green"

### Morgan (ML Specialist):
"For ML components, health includes:
- Model loaded successfully
- Feature pipeline working
- Prediction latency within bounds
- Model drift detection active
- Accuracy monitoring enabled"

### Casey (Exchange Specialist):
"Exchange health is critical:
- WebSocket connections active
- Rate limits not exceeded
- Order placement working
- Market data flowing
- Failover ready"

### Riley (Testing):
"Health checks need comprehensive testing:
- Simulate component failures
- Test timeout handling
- Verify aggregation logic
- Test alert triggering
- Mock various failure scenarios"

### Sam (Code Quality):
"No fake health checks! Each check must:
- Actually verify component functionality
- Not just return {'status': 'ok'}
- Include meaningful diagnostics
- Provide actionable error messages"

### Avery (Data Engineer):
"Database and data pipeline health:
- Connection pool healthy
- Query performance acceptable
- Data freshness checks
- Backup status
- Storage capacity"

## Requirements Consensus

### Functional Requirements
1. **Aggregate health from all components**
   - Use Component Registry for discovery
   - Support custom health check functions
   - Handle async health checks

2. **Health Check Types**
   - Liveness: Is component running?
   - Readiness: Can component handle requests?
   - Deep health: Full functionality check

3. **Aggregation Logic**
   - Overall system health calculation
   - Component dependency consideration
   - Critical vs non-critical components

4. **Performance (Jordan's requirements)**
   - Parallel execution of checks
   - 5-second result caching
   - < 100ms response time
   - Circuit breaker for failing checks

5. **Risk Validation (Quinn's requirements)**
   - Verify all risk limits enforced
   - Check emergency systems active
   - Validate position monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Real-time updates via WebSocket**
2. **Historical health tracking**
3. **Alert triggering on degradation**
4. **Prometheus metrics export**
5. **Grafana dashboard integration**

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All health checks execute in parallel
- [ ] Response time < 100ms (Jordan)
- [ ] Results cached for 5 seconds
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- [ ] Risk systems validated (Quinn)
- [ ] ML health monitored (Morgan)
- [ ] Exchange connectivity verified (Casey)
- [ ] No fake implementations (Sam)
- [ ] 100% test coverage (Riley)
- [ ] Database health tracked (Avery)

## Risk Mitigation
- Health checks must not impact system performance
- Failing health checks shouldn't crash the system
- Provide graceful degradation
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Timeline
- Estimated: 4-6 hours
- Priority: P1 (High)
