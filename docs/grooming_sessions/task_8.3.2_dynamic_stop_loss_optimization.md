# Grooming Session: Task 8.3.2 - Dynamic Stop-Loss Optimization

**Date**: 2025-01-11
**Task**: 8.3.2 - Dynamic Stop-Loss Optimization
**Epic**: ALT1 Enhancement Layers (Week 3)
**Estimated Effort**: 10 hours

## Overview

Implement intelligent stop-loss management that adapts to market conditions, volatility, and price action patterns. Move beyond static stops to dynamic, ML-enhanced stop placement that maximizes profit while protecting capital.

## Team Discussion

### Quinn (Risk Manager)
"This is CRITICAL! Static stops are killing our profits. We need:
- Volatility-adjusted stops that breathe with the market
- Protection against stop hunts
- Time-based stop tightening
- Correlation-aware stops for portfolio protection"

### Morgan (ML Specialist)
"I can predict optimal stop levels using:
- Historical stop hit probability
- Support/resistance clustering
- Volatility forecasting
- Adverse excursion analysis
- Stop hunt detection patterns"

### Sam (Quant Developer)
"The mathematics must be sound:
- ATR-based calculations with multipliers
- Parabolic SAR implementation
- Chandelier exits
- Keltner channel stops
- Statistical stop placement using standard deviations"

### Casey (Exchange Specialist)
"Exchange considerations:
- Hidden stop orders to avoid hunting
- Synthetic stops executed client-side
- Slippage estimation for stop execution
- Multiple exchange stop synchronization"

### Jordan (Performance)
"Keep it fast and reliable:
- Real-time stop adjustment <50μs
- Cached support/resistance levels
- Pre-calculated volatility bands
- Efficient order modification"

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
pub struct DynamicStopLossOptimization {
    ml_predictor: StopLossPredictor,        // ML optimal stops
    volatility_stops: VolatilityAdaptive,   // ATR/GARCH based
    sr_analyzer: SupportResistanceStops,    // S/R anchoring
    time_decay: TimeDecayTightening,        // Time-based
    anti_hunt: AntiStopHunt,                // Hunt protection
    trailing: TrailingStopOptimizer,        // Dynamic trailing
    correlation: CorrelationStops,          // Portfolio stops
    psychology: PsychologicalLevels,        // Level avoidance
    conditional: ConditionalStopLogic,      // Complex conditions
    analytics: StopPerformanceAnalytics,    // Performance tracking
}
```

### Stop Calculation Pipeline
1. **Initial Placement** → ML-predicted optimal level
2. **Volatility Adjustment** → Scale for current volatility
3. **S/R Anchoring** → Adjust to key levels
4. **Hunt Protection** → Widen if hunt detected
5. **Psychology Check** → Avoid obvious levels
6. **Portfolio Check** → Adjust for correlations
7. **Final Validation** → Ensure risk limits
