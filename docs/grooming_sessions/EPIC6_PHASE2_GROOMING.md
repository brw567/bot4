## üéØ Phase 2: Exchange Integration Requirements

### Alex (Team Lead): Strategic Overview
"Team, we've achieved incredible performance with the Rust core. Now we need to connect to exchanges for execution. Priority is speed, reliability, and coverage. We need at least 4 exchanges operational by end of week 1."

**Critical Requirements:**
- Unified interface for all exchanges
- Sub-second execution latency
- Automatic failover mechanisms
- Fee optimization across venues

### Casey (Exchange Specialist): Technical Requirements
```python
exchange_priorities = {
    'tier_1_critical': {
        'binance': 'Largest volume, best liquidity',
        'okx': 'Unified account, excellent derivatives',
        'bybit': 'Good perps, hedge mode',
        'dydx': 'Decentralized, no KYC'
    },
    'tier_2_important': {
        'coinbase': 'USD pairs, institutional',
        'kraken': 'EUR pairs, reliability',
        'kucoin': 'Small caps, gems'
    },
    'dex_essential': {
        '1inch': 'Best routing',
        'uniswap_v3': 'Concentrated liquidity'
    }
}
```

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Start with Binance REST + WebSocket
2. Add OKX unified account
3. Implement smart order routing
4. Test with paper trading first

### Quinn (Risk Manager): Risk Considerations
"Each exchange connection introduces risks. We need proper safeguards."

**Risk Controls Required:**
- API key permissions (trade only, no withdrawals)
- Rate limit monitoring
- Balance reconciliation every minute
- Maximum exposure per exchange: 30%
- Automatic disconnect on anomalies

### Jordan (DevOps): Infrastructure Needs
```yaml
infrastructure:
  connections:
    max_per_exchange: 5
    heartbeat_interval: 30s
    reconnect_strategy: exponential_backoff
  
  monitoring:
    latency_tracking: true
    rate_limit_alerts: true
    connection_health: true
  
  failover:
    primary: binance
    secondary: okx
    tertiary: bybit
```

### Morgan (ML): Integration with ML System
"Exchange data feeds our models. We need normalized data across all venues."

**Data Requirements:**
- Unified orderbook format
- Normalized timestamps
- Consistent symbol naming
- Aggregated liquidity metrics

### Sam (Quant): Arbitrage Opportunities
"Multiple exchanges = arbitrage opportunities. We need fast detection."

**Arbitrage Features:**
- Cross-exchange price monitoring
- Fee-adjusted profit calculation
- Atomic execution where possible
- Triangular arbitrage detection

### Riley (Testing): Test Strategy
"Each exchange needs comprehensive testing before production."

**Test Plan:**
1. Unit tests for each connector
2. Integration tests with mock data
3. Paper trading for 24 hours
4. Small real trades ($10-100)
5. Gradual scaling to full size

### Avery (Data): Data Pipeline
"We need to store and analyze data from all exchanges."

**Data Flow:**
- Real-time ingestion via WebSocket
- TimescaleDB for tick storage
- Redis for hot data cache
- 90-day retention policy
