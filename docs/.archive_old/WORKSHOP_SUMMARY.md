## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Build Docker image**: `./deploy.sh build`
2. **Test locally**: `./deploy.sh deploy-local`
3. **Run validation**: `./scripts/validate-deployment.sh`

### Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] Install kubectl for Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] Configure cloud provider credentials
- [ ] Set up persistent storage classes
- [ ] Configure TLS certificates
- [ ] Update secrets with real API keys
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Load test the deployment
- [ ] Security scan the images

### Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Build and tag for production
VERSION=v1.0.0 ./deploy.sh build

# 2. Deploy to staging first
ENVIRONMENT=staging ./deploy.sh deploy-k8s

# 3. Run integration tests
./deploy.sh test-integration

# 4. Deploy to production
ENVIRONMENT=production VERSION=v1.0.0 ./deploy.sh deploy-k8s

# 5. Monitor deployment
kubectl rollout status deployment/bot3-trading-engine -n bot3
```
