            // Backtest in parallel
            let results = self.backtester.test_all(candidates).await;
            
            // Select best performers
            let winners = self.select_top_strategies(results);
            
            // Deploy immediately
            self.deploy_strategies(winners).await;

        let target = match (market_regime, volatility) {
            (MarketRegime::BullRun, High) => 200.0,  // Maximum extraction
