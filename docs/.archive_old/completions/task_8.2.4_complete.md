## Technical Highlights

### 1. Dynamic Correlation with Regime Awareness
```rust
// Correlations adapt to market conditions
match regime {
    MarketRegime::Crisis => {
        // Correlations spike toward 1 in crisis
        correlation_matrix * 0.7 + crisis_matrix * 0.3
    },
    MarketRegime::Bull => {
        // Lower correlations in bull markets
        correlation_matrix * 0.7 + bull_matrix * 0.3
    }
}
```

### 2. Lead-Lag Predictive Analysis
```rust
// S&P 500 leads Bitcoin by 15 minutes
if granger_causality("SP500", "BTC") > 0.7 {
    lead_time: Duration::from_mins(15),
    signal: Follow SP500 direction
}
```

### 3. Crisis Protection Activation
```rust
// When VIX > 40, activate crisis mode
if vix > 40.0 || correlation_breakdown_detected {
    activate_crisis_protection();
    reduce_positions_by(50%);
    increase_hedges();
}
```

## Cross-Market Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Macro Event Impact
```
Fed Rate Decision: +0.25% hike
Impact Analysis:
  - Dollar Index: +0.8% (strengthening)
  - S&P 500: -1.2% (risk-off)
  - Gold: +0.5% (safe haven)
  - Bitcoin: -2.5% (risk asset selloff)
Prediction: BTC weakness for 24-48 hours
Action: Reduce long exposure by 30%
```

### Example 2: Leading Indicator Signal
```
Market: S&P 500
Movement: -3% flash crash
Lead Time: 12 minutes before crypto
Correlation: 0.78 with BTC
Confidence: 85%
Action: IMMEDIATE SHORT BTC
Result: Captured 2.3% move
```

### Example 3: Crisis Correlation Shift
```
Normal Correlations:
  BTC-SP500: 0.45
  BTC-Gold: 0.20
  BTC-DXY: -0.30

Crisis Correlations (VIX > 40):
  BTC-SP500: 0.85 (â†‘ 89%)
  BTC-Gold: 0.65 (â†‘ 225%)
  BTC-DXY: -0.70 (â†‘ 133%)

Action: Reduce all positions, correlations too high
```

## Integration with Signal Enhancement

```rust
// Cross-market correlation enhances signals
match correlation_analysis {
    sp500_leading_indicator => {
        signal.confidence *= 1.4,
        signal.time_window = Duration::from_mins(15),
        signal.urgency = IMMEDIATE,
    },
    crisis_detected => {
        signal.position_size *= 0.3,  // Reduce by 70%
        signal.add_hedge = true,
        signal.stop_loss = TIGHT,
    },
    macro_favorable => {
        signal.hold_duration *= 2,
        signal.target *= 1.5,
    },
}
```
