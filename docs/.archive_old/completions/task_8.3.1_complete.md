## Technical Highlights

### 1. Dynamic Kelly Criterion
```rust
// 25% fractional Kelly with safety adjustments
let full_kelly = (win_prob * odds - loss_prob) / odds;
let adjusted = full_kelly * 0.25 * correlation_adjustment;
```

### 2. Multi-Factor Risk Combination
```rust
// Combine 8 risk factors with weights
let final_weight = 
    kelly_weight * 0.20 +
    volatility_weight * 0.15 +
    drawdown_weight * 0.15 +
    correlation_weight * 0.15 +
    time_weight * 0.10 +
    liquidity_weight * 0.10 +
    performance_weight * 0.10 +
    budget_weight * 0.05;
```

### 3. Risk Constraint Application
```rust
// Multiple safety constraints
if size < min_position_size { return 0; }
if size > max_position_size { size = max_position_size; }
if exposure + size > max_exposure { size = max_exposure - exposure; }
if !risk_budget.can_allocate(size) { size = remaining_budget; }
```

## Risk Adjustment Examples

### Example 1: High Confidence Signal
```
Original Signal: BTC Long $10,000
Win Probability: 70%
Expected Profit: 2%
Expected Loss: 1%

Risk Adjustments:
  Kelly: 0.175 (17.5% of capital)
  Volatility: 0.8 (high vol = reduce)
  Drawdown: 1.0 (no drawdown)
  Correlation: 0.7 (existing BTC position)
  Time: 0.95 (fresh signal)
  Liquidity: 1.0 (deep market)
  Performance: 1.1 (strategy performing well)
  Budget: 0.9 (90% budget remaining)

Final Weight: 0.086 (8.6%)
Adjusted Size: $860
```

### Example 2: Risk Reduction During Drawdown
```
Current Drawdown: 8%
Risk Budget Used: 75%
Portfolio Correlation: 0.65

Signal Adjustment:
  Base Size: $5,000
  Drawdown Reduction: 0.6 (40% reduction)
  Budget Constraint: 0.25 (only 25% budget left)
  
Final Size: $750 (85% reduction)
```

### Example 3: Multi-Asset Kelly Optimization
```
Portfolio Positions:
  BTC: Win 65%, RR 1.5:1 → Kelly 9.75%
  ETH: Win 60%, RR 2:1 → Kelly 10%
  SOL: Win 70%, RR 1:1 → Kelly 8.75%
  
Total Kelly: 28.5%
Correlation Adjustment: 0.6
Final Allocation: 17.1% (scaled down)
```

## Integration with Signal Enhancement

```rust
// Risk adjustment integrates with all signals
pub fn process_enhanced_signal(signal: EnhancedSignal) {
    // Get base signal from enhancement layers
    let base = signal.get_strength();
    
    // Apply risk adjustments
    let risk_adjusted = risk_system.process_signal(&signal);
    
    // Final execution size
    let final_size = risk_adjusted.adjusted_size;
    
    // Track for learning
    risk_system.update_with_result(&signal.id, &result);
}
```
