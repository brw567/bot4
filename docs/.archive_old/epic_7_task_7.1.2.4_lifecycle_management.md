# Grooming Session: Task 7.1.2.4 - Strategy Lifecycle Management
**Date**: January 11, 2025
**Participants**: All Team Members
**Task**: Add strategy lifecycle management [ENHANCED - Genealogy]
**Epic**: 7 - Autonomous Rust Platform Rebuild

## Task Overview
Implement comprehensive strategy lifecycle management with genealogy tracking, state transitions, and performance monitoring throughout strategy evolution.

## Team Discussion

### Alex (Team Lead):
"This is crucial for strategy governance. We need to track strategies from birth to retirement, including their entire evolutionary history. The lifecycle should support:
- Development → Validation → Paper → Limited → Active → Deprecated states
- Parent-child relationships for evolved strategies
- Performance metrics at each stage
- Automatic promotion/demotion based on performance"

### Morgan (ML Specialist):
"I want to track ML model versioning within the lifecycle. Each strategy generation should maintain:
- Model weights checkpointing
- Training history
- Feature importance evolution
- Catastrophic forgetting prevention
This genealogy helps us understand which evolutionary paths lead to success."

### Sam (Quant Developer):
"From a TA perspective, we need:
- Indicator parameter evolution tracking
- Pattern discovery lineage
- Backtesting results at each stage
- Real vs paper performance comparison
No fake lifecycle transitions - real validation required!"

### Quinn (Risk Manager):
"Risk limits must adjust per lifecycle stage:
- Development: Zero real capital
- Validation: Backtesting only
- Paper: Simulated trades
- Limited: <0.1% capital
- Active: Full allocation
- Deprecated: Graceful shutdown
Each promotion requires risk approval!"

### Jordan (DevOps):
"Performance monitoring per stage:
- Resource usage tracking
- Latency measurements
- Error rates
- Recovery metrics
Automatic rollback if performance degrades."

### Casey (Exchange Specialist):
"Exchange-specific considerations:
- Rate limit allocation per stage
- Order type restrictions
- Market access levels
- Fee tier optimization
Active strategies get priority access."

### Riley (Frontend/Testing):
"UI requirements:
- Visual lifecycle state machine
- Family tree visualization
- Performance timeline
- Transition history
Testing must validate all state transitions."

### Avery (Data Engineer):
"Data persistence needs:
- Complete audit trail
- State transition logs
- Performance snapshots
- Genealogy database
Time-series tracking for analysis."

## Enhanced Task Breakdown

After team discussion, expanding from 1 to 10 subtasks:

1. **State Machine Implementation** (Alex)
   - Define lifecycle states
   - Transition rules engine
   - State persistence
   - Rollback capability

2. **Genealogy Tracking System** (Morgan)
   - Parent-child relationships
   - Evolution tree structure
   - Mutation tracking
   - Success path analysis

3. **Performance Monitoring** (Sam)
   - Metrics per state
   - Performance thresholds
   - Comparison framework
   - Anomaly detection

4. **Validation Framework** (Quinn)
   - Stage-specific validators
   - Risk limit enforcement
   - Capital allocation rules
   - Safety checks

5. **Promotion/Demotion Logic** (Jordan)
   - Automatic transitions
   - Performance triggers
   - Manual overrides
   - Emergency demotion

6. **Resource Management** (Casey)
   - Exchange quota allocation
   - Priority scheduling
   - Connection pooling
   - Rate limit distribution

7. **Audit System** (Avery)
   - Complete history tracking
   - Transition logging
   - Performance archival
   - Compliance reporting

8. **Recovery Mechanisms** (Jordan)
   - State recovery
   - Checkpoint restoration
   - Failover handling
   - Graceful degradation

9. **Visualization Interface** (Riley)
   - State diagram display
   - Family tree viewer
   - Performance charts
   - Transition timeline

10. **Integration Points** (Alex)
    - Registry integration
    - Evolution engine hooks
    - Risk system connection
    - Monitoring bridges

## Consensus Reached

**Agreed Approach**:
1. Implement robust state machine with clear transitions
2. Full genealogy tracking for evolutionary history
3. Performance-based automatic promotion/demotion
4. Risk limits enforced at each stage
5. Complete audit trail for compliance

**Innovation Opportunities**:
- ML-driven promotion predictions
- Genetic marker identification for successful lineages
- Automatic strategy retirement based on market regime changes
- Cross-strategy learning from family trees

**Success Metrics**:
- Zero invalid state transitions
- 100% genealogy tracking accuracy
- <100ms state transition time
- Complete audit trail coverage

## Architecture Integration
- Connects to Strategy Registry for strategy storage
- Feeds Evolution Engine with lineage information
- Integrates with Risk Manager for stage-based limits
- Provides metrics to Monitoring System

## Task Sizing
**Original Estimate**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Revised Estimate**: Large (4-5 hours)
**Justification**: Genealogy tracking and state machine complexity

## Next Steps
1. Implement state machine with all transitions
2. Build genealogy tracking database
3. Create validation framework
4. Add performance monitoring
5. Integrate with existing systems
