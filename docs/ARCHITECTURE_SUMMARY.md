## 📊 SYSTEM LOGIC BY LAYER

### Layer 0: Safety Logic
```
IF emergency_button_pressed OR panic_condition_triggered:
    IMMEDIATELY:
        - Cancel all orders
        - Close all positions
        - Disable trading
        - Alert operators
```

### Layer 1: Data Logic
```
FOR each data_event:
    IF passes_validation:
        - Normalize to standard format
        - Store in TimescaleDB
        - Compute features
        - Update feature store
    ELSE:
        - Quarantine for analysis
        - Alert data team
```

### Layer 2: Risk Logic
```
FOR each trade_signal:
    position_size = kelly_fraction * capital * 0.25
    IF position_size > max_position_limit:
        position_size = max_position_limit
    IF portfolio_heat > 0.25:
        position_size = 0  // Don't trade
    IF drawdown > 15%:
        position_size *= 0.5  // Reduce risk
```

### Layer 3: ML Logic
```
features = get_features(market_state)
predictions = ensemble([
    dqn_agent.predict(features),
    gnn.predict(features),
    transformer.predict(features),
    xgboost.predict(features)
])
confidence = calculate_agreement(predictions)
IF confidence > threshold:
    RETURN prediction
ELSE:
    RETURN no_trade
```

### Layer 4: Strategy Logic
```
regime = detect_market_regime()
SWITCH regime:
    CASE trending:
        USE momentum_strategies
    CASE range_bound:
        USE mean_reversion + market_making
    CASE volatile:
        USE market_making_only
```

### Layer 5: Execution Logic
```
order = create_order(signal)
venues = rank_venues_by_score()
IF order.size > large_threshold:
    splits = calculate_optimal_splits(order)
    FOR split IN splits:
        route_to_best_venue(split)
ELSE:
    route_to_best_venue(order)
```

## 🔄 AUTO-ADJUSTMENT LOGIC

### Real-Time (Every 100ms)
```python
current_spread = calculate_spread(market_state)
IF volatility_increased:
    new_spread = current_spread * 1.2
ELIF inventory_skewed:
    new_spread = adjust_for_inventory(current_spread)
update_quotes(new_spread)
```

### Tactical (Every Hour)
```python
performance = calculate_rolling_sharpe(1_hour)
FOR strategy IN active_strategies:
    IF strategy.sharpe < 0.5:
        strategy.weight *= 0.9
    ELIF strategy.sharpe > 2.0:
        strategy.weight *= 1.1
normalize_weights()
```

### Strategic (Daily)
```python
IF days_since_retrain > 7:
    new_data = get_recent_data(7_days)
    retrain_models(new_data)
    backtest_performance = validate_models()
    IF backtest_performance > current_performance:
        deploy_new_models()
    ELSE:
        keep_current_models()
```
