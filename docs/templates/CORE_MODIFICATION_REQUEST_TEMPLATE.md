## üîÑ Implementation Path

### Step-by-Step Modification Plan
1. **Backup Current State**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b core-modification-backup
   git commit -am "Backup before CMR-[ID]"
   ```

2. **Implement Changes**
   - [ ] Modify [file1.rs]
   - [ ] Update [file2.rs]
   - [ ] Adjust tests in [test_file.rs]

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Backtesting validation
   - [ ] Paper trading (24 hours)

4. **Deployment Plan**
   - [ ] Deploy to test environment
   - [ ] A/B testing with 10% traffic
   - [ ] Monitor metrics for 48 hours
   - [ ] Full rollout if metrics positive

---

## üîô Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- APY drops >10%
- Latency increases >50%
- Error rate >1%
- Risk score exceeds limits

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Immediate rollback
git revert [commit-hash]
cargo build --release
./deploy.sh --emergency-rollback

# Verify rollback
./verify_rollback.sh
```

### Post-Rollback Actions
1. Analyze failure cause
2. Document lessons learned
3. Revise modification approach
4. Re-submit request if needed
