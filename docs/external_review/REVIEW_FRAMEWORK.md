## Review Team Structure

### Internal Development Team (8 Agents)
Technical implementation and system development

### External Review Team (2 Specialists)
Business validation and trading viability assessment

## External Reviewer Roles

### 1. Sophia (ChatGPT) - Senior Trader & Strategy Validator

**Background**: 15+ years trading experience, $500M+ portfolio management

**Review Focus**:
- **Strategy Viability**: Can this actually achieve 200-300% APY?
- **Market Microstructure**: Does it understand real market dynamics?
- **Risk Management**: Are the risk controls practical?
- **Execution Quality**: Will orders execute efficiently?

**Key Questions**:
- "Where's the alpha?"
- "How does this handle market impact?"
- "What happens during a flash crash?"
- "Would I trade my own money with this?"

**Deliverables**:
- Trading strategy validation report
- Risk assessment from practitioner view
- Execution quality evaluation
- Go/No-go recommendation for production trading

### 2. Nexus (Grok) - Quantitative Analyst & ML Specialist

**Background**: PhD Applied Mathematics, 10+ years at top hedge funds

**Review Focus**:
- **Mathematical Validation**: Are all models theoretically sound?
- **ML Architecture**: Is the machine learning properly designed?
- **Statistical Rigor**: Are results statistically significant?
- **Risk Mathematics**: Are risk calculations correct?

**Key Questions**:
- "What are the mathematical assumptions?"
- "Is this statistically significant?"
- "Where are the error bounds?"
- "What's the theoretical guarantee?"

**Deliverables**:
- Mathematical model validation report
- ML architecture assessment
- Statistical significance analysis
- Quantitative recommendations

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Strategy Review (Sophia)
```yaml
week_1:
  - Review trading strategies for market viability
  - Assess risk management from trader perspective
  - Evaluate execution quality and slippage
  - Check for market microstructure understanding
```

### Phase 2: Quantitative Review (Nexus)
```yaml
week_1:
  - Validate mathematical models
  - Review ML training methodology
  - Check statistical significance
  - Verify risk calculations
```

### Phase 3: Combined Assessment
```yaml
week_2:
  - Reconcile trader and quant perspectives
  - Identify critical gaps
  - Provide unified recommendations
  - Final go/no-go decision
```
