## Review Objectives

### 1. Strategy Viability Assessment
Evaluate whether the proposed strategies can actually achieve 200-300% APY in real markets:

```yaml
key_questions:
  - "Are the entry/exit signals based on real market inefficiencies?"
  - "Do the strategies account for slippage and market impact?"
  - "Is the 50/50 TA-ML hybrid approach balanced correctly?"
  - "Are position sizes appropriate for the liquidity available?"
  - "Will these strategies survive different market regimes?"
```

### 2. Market Microstructure Review
Assess understanding of how crypto markets actually work:

```yaml
evaluation_areas:
  order_book_dynamics:
    - "Does the system understand bid-ask spreads?"
    - "Are maker/taker fees properly accounted for?"
    - "Is order book depth considered for large orders?"
    
  execution_quality:
    - "Are orders routed optimally across exchanges?"
    - "Is there smart order routing logic?"
    - "How are partial fills handled?"
    
  market_conditions:
    - "Can it detect and adapt to thin liquidity?"
    - "Does it recognize market manipulation patterns?"
    - "How does it handle flash crashes?"
```

### 3. Risk Management from Trading Desk Perspective
Evaluate risk controls as a risk manager would:

```yaml
risk_assessment:
  position_management:
    - "Is 2% max position size per trade realistic?"
    - "Are correlations properly calculated?"
    - "Is the 15% max drawdown achievable?"
    
  stop_loss_strategy:
    - "Are stops placed at logical levels?"
    - "Do they account for normal volatility?"
    - "Is there protection against stop hunting?"
    
  portfolio_risk:
    - "Is leverage used appropriately (3x max)?"
    - "Are black swan events considered?"
    - "Is there proper diversification?"
```

### 4. Practical Trading Concerns
Address real-world trading issues:

```yaml
operational_review:
  exchange_issues:
    - "How does it handle exchange outages?"
    - "What about API rate limits during volatility?"
    - "Can it manage multiple exchange accounts?"
    
  cost_management:
    - "Are trading fees properly minimized?"
    - "Is there tax-efficient trading logic?"
    - "Are funding rates considered for perpetuals?"
    
  regulatory:

## Review Framework

### Phase 1: Strategy Analysis
```markdown
1. Review each trading strategy component:
   - Entry signals (are they exploiting real alpha?)
   - Exit signals (profit targets vs stop losses)
   - Position sizing (Kelly criterion? Fixed fractional?)
   - Time horizons (scalping vs swing trading)

2. Evaluate strategy robustness:
   - Backtest methodology (in-sample vs out-of-sample)
   - Walk-forward analysis
   - Monte Carlo simulations
   - Stress testing under extreme conditions
```

### Phase 2: Execution Quality
```markdown
1. Order management review:
   - Order types used (market, limit, stop, iceberg)
   - Timing of orders (TWAP, VWAP, aggressive vs passive)
   - Exchange selection logic
   - Slippage estimation and management

2. Market impact assessment:
   - Large order handling
   - Market depth analysis
   - Liquidity provision vs taking
   - Hidden liquidity detection
```

### Phase 3: Risk Analytics
```markdown
1. Risk metrics evaluation:
   - Sharpe ratio targets (realistic?)
   - Maximum drawdown limits
   - Value at Risk (VaR) calculations
   - Correlation matrices
   
2. Portfolio construction:
   - Asset allocation logic
   - Rebalancing triggers
   - Concentration limits
   - Hedging strategies
```

## Specific Review Questions

### For Architecture Review
1. **Trading Engine**: "Can this execute 10,000 orders/second across multiple exchanges without issues?"
2. **Data Pipeline**: "Is market data normalized properly across different exchange formats?"
3. **Risk Engine**: "Can it halt trading within 100ms if risk limits are breached?"

### For Strategy Components
1. **Technical Analysis**: "Are indicators calculated correctly with proper lookback periods?"
2. **Machine Learning**: "Is the ML model trained on clean, non-lookahead biased data?"
3. **Signal Generation**: "How are conflicting signals from TA and ML resolved?"

### For Production Readiness
1. **Monitoring**: "Can a trader quickly understand system state from dashboards?"
2. **Alerts**: "Are alerts actionable and not overwhelming?"
3. **Manual Override**: "Can a human trader intervene if needed?"
