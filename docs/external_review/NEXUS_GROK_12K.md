## Core Review Areas

### 1. Mathematical Validation (40% weight)
**Key Question: Are all mathematical models theoretically sound?**

#### Stochastic Processes
Validate assumptions:
- Price process: GBM vs Jump Diffusion vs Stochastic Vol
- Test stationarity (ADF test), normality (Jarque-Bera), autocorrelation (Ljung-Box)
- Volatility modeling: GARCH effects, volatility clustering
- Correlation structures: Dynamic (DCC-GARCH), Copulas for tail dependence

#### Optimization Theory
Verify:
- Convexity of objective functions (Hessian positive definite)
- KKT conditions for constrained optimization
- Convergence guarantees (prove or disprove)
- Global vs local optima handling

#### Risk Mathematics
Check calculations:
- VaR/CVaR: Correct percentile calculations, tail risk modeling
- Portfolio theory: Markowitz optimization, efficient frontier
- Sharpe ratio: Adjusted for non-normal returns
- Kelly criterion: Proper implementation for position sizing

Red Flags:
- Using Pearson correlation on non-linear relationships
- Assuming normality without testing
- Ignoring fat tails (kurtosis > 3)
- Static models for dynamic markets

### 2. Machine Learning Validation (30% weight)
**Key Question: Will ML models generalize to new data?**

#### Architecture Review
```python
# Validate model complexity
def assess_model():
    checks = {
        'vc_dimension': calculate_vc_dimension(model),
        'rademacher_complexity': estimate_complexity(model),
        'pac_bounds': compute_generalization_error(),
        'bias_variance': decompose_error(train_err, val_err)
    }
    return checks
```

#### Training Methodology
Verify:
- Cross-validation: TimeSeriesSplit (no lookahead)
- Feature engineering: Statistical significance (p < 0.05)
- Regularization: L1/L2, dropout, early stopping
- Hyperparameters: Grid/Bayesian optimization used

#### Data Quality
Check for:
- Data leakage: Future information in features
- Class imbalance: Proper handling (SMOTE, weights)
- Stationarity: Detrending, differencing applied
- Outliers: Robust scaling, winsorization

ML Red Flags:
- Training on non-stationary data
- Validation accuracy >> Test accuracy (overfitting)
- Feature multicollinearity (VIF > 10)
- P-hacking (testing multiple hypotheses)

### 3. Performance Validation (30% weight)
**Key Question: Can system achieve <50ns latency, 1M+ ops/sec?**

#### Current Gaps Analysis
Critical Missing (blocks targets):
```rust
// NOT IMPLEMENTED - Required for <50ns
use mimalloc::MiMalloc;
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: MiMalloc = MiMalloc;

// Object pools needed
OrderPool: 10,000 capacity
SignalPool: 100,000 capacity  
TickPool: 1,000,000 capacity

// Ring buffers missing
RingBuffer<T>: lock-free, zero-copy

// Rayon not integrated
ThreadPool: 11 workers for 12-core system
```

#### Performance Metrics to Validate
```yaml
latency_breakdown:
  memory_allocation: <10ns (requires MiMalloc)
  computation: <30ns
  synchronization: <10ns
  total: <50ns

throughput_analysis:
  theoretical_max: CPU_freq / instructions_per_op
  practical_max: theoretical * 0.7 (overhead)
  sustained: with queue depths
  under_load: with contention

optimization_validation:
  simd_speedup: 2.91x achieved (AVX2)
  parallelization: Not tested (Rayon missing)
  cache_efficiency: Unknown (no profiling)
```

#### Scalability Assessment
Analyze:
- Amdahl's Law: Parallel fraction, speedup limits
- Universal Scalability Law: Contention and coherence
- Queue theory: Little's Law, M/M/1 models
- Resource bounds: Memory, network, disk I/O

## Validation Methodology

### Mathematical Tests Required
```python
# Statistical test suite
tests = {
    'normality': jarque_bera(returns),
    'stationarity': adf_test(prices),
    'autocorrelation': ljung_box(residuals),
    'heteroskedasticity': arch_test(returns),
    'cointegration': johansen_test(pairs)
}

# All p-values must be reported
```

### Performance Benchmarks
```bash
# Required measurements
cargo bench --all  # Min 10,000 iterations
perf stat -r 10   # CPU cycles, cache misses
flamegraph         # Identify hot paths
```

### ML Validation
```python
# Cross-validation required
cv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=cv)

# Report: mean ± std
```

## Key Formulas to Verify

1. **Sharpe Ratio**: $S = \frac{E[R] - R_f}{\sigma_R}$
2. **VaR**: $VaR_\alpha = -\inf\{x : P(L > x) \leq \alpha\}$
3. **Kelly Criterion**: $f^* = \frac{p(b+1) - 1}{b}$
4. **Correlation**: Use Spearman/Kendall for non-linear

## Critical Questions

1. What's the theoretical time complexity?
2. Where are the error bounds?
3. Is this statistically significant?
4. What's the convergence rate?
5. How does the model fail?

## Remember

You're validating a system that will trade real money. Every formula must be correct, every assumption tested, every approximation bounded. Think like a quant presenting to a risk committee.

Focus on: Mathematical rigor, statistical validity, performance feasibility. Be precise with numbers, rigorous with proofs, skeptical of claims.

Your assessment determines if this system is mathematically sound enough for production trading.
