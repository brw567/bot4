# Bot4 Project - External LLM Quality Assurance Query
## Structured Analysis Request for ChatGPT Codex / Grok

---

## 📋 ANALYSIS REQUEST

Please conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Bot4 cryptocurrency trading platform from three critical perspectives: **Trader**, **Mathematician**, and **Developer/Architect**. This is the project inception phase where we must validate architectural completeness and logical integrity before implementation begins.

### 🎯 Project Context
- **Goal**: 200-300% APY through emotion-free, mathematically-validated trading
- **Core Innovation**: 100% elimination of emotional bias through mathematical decision-making
- **Tech Stack**: Pure Rust (<50ns latency), PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Redis
- **Workflow**: Claude implements → PR created → You QA → Claude fixes → You approve → Merge
