## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - Implementation Details

### Implemented Architecture Components

#### 1. Circuit Breaker System (INFRA_001)
```yaml
component: CircuitBreaker
location: rust_core/crates/infrastructure/src/circuit_breaker.rs
architecture_pattern: Lock-free Concurrent
implementation:
  - state_management: AtomicU8 for lock-free state
  - failure_tracking: AtomicU64 for monotonic timestamps
  - configuration: ArcSwap for hot-reloading
  - concurrency: CAS operations for Half-Open tokens
  
performance:
  - overhead: <1μs per call
  - state_transitions: atomic, zero contention
  - memory: zero allocations in hot path
  
design_decisions:
  - Replaced RwLock with AtomicU64 (Sophia's requirement)
  - Global state derived from components (not separate)
  - RAII CallGuard for automatic outcome recording
  - Clock trait for testability
```

#### 2. Risk Engine Architecture (RISK_001)
```yaml
component: RiskEngine
location: rust_core/crates/risk_engine/

implementation:
  checks:
    - position_limits: 2% max (hard constraint)
    - stop_loss: mandatory enforcement
    - correlation: 0.7 maximum
    - drawdown: 15% with kill switch
    
  emergency_system:
    - kill_switch: AtomicBool activation
    - trip_conditions: 8 different triggers
    - recovery_plans: standard and aggressive
    
performance:
  - pre_trade_checks: p99 @ 10μs
  - throughput: 120,000 checks/sec

design_decisions:
  - Lock-free atomics for all hot paths

```

#### 3. Order Management Architecture (ORDER_001)
```yaml
component: OrderManagementSystem
location: rust_core/crates/order_management/

implementation:
  state_machine:
    - states: Created → Validated → Submitted → PartiallyFilled → Filled
    - transitions: AtomicU8 with CAS
    - invalid_states: impossible by design
    
  routing_engine:
    - strategies: BestPrice, LowestFee, SmartRoute
    - exchange_scoring: liquidity + fees + latency
    - dynamic_selection: based on market conditions
    
performance:
  - processing: p99 @ 98μs
  - throughput: 10,000 orders/sec burst
  - state_changes: lock-free atomic
  
design_decisions:
  - Atomic state transitions prevent race conditions
  - Smart routing maximizes execution quality
  - Position tracking integrated for real-time P&L
```

#### 4. WebSocket Infrastructure (WS_001)
```yaml
component: WebSocketInfrastructure
location: rust_core/crates/websocket/
architecture_pattern: Auto-Reconnecting Connection Pool
implementation:
  connection_management:
    - auto_reconnect: exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s...)
    - connection_pool: round-robin load balancing
    - message_routing: type-safe with serde
    
  reliability:
    - message_ordering: sequence numbers
    - duplicate_detection: message IDs
    - recovery: replay from last known state
    
performance:
  - throughput: 12,000 msg/sec sustained
  - latency: p99 @ 0.95ms
  - reconnection: <5s recovery time
  
design_decisions:
  - Tokio-tungstenite for async operations
  - Channel-based message passing
  - Backpressure handling with bounded channels
```

#### 5. Database Architecture (DB_001)
```yaml
component: DatabaseSchema
location: sql/001_core_schema.sql
architecture_pattern: Time-Series Optimized with Constraints
implementation:
  technology: PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB
  
  tables:
    - trades: hypertable, 1-day chunks
    - orders: partitioned by date
    - positions: real-time tracking
    - risk_metrics: continuous aggregates
    
  constraints:
    - stop_loss: NOT NULL enforced
    - position_size: CHECK (< 0.02 * portfolio)
    - correlation: trigger validation
    
performance:
  - write_throughput: 10,000 rows/sec
  - query_latency: <10ms for aggregates
  - compression: 10x for historical data
  
design_decisions:
  - TimescaleDB for time-series optimization
  - Constraints enforce risk rules at DB level
  - Docker containerization for portability
```

### Integration Points

```yaml
component_integration:
  risk_engine → circuit_breaker:
    - Protected risk checks
    - Fault isolation
    
  order_management → risk_engine:
    - Pre-trade validation
    - Position limits
    
  websocket → order_management:
    - Market data feed
    - Order submissions
    
  all_components → database:
    - Audit logging
    - State persistence
```

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless components
   - Shared-nothing architecture
   - Database read replicas

2. **Vertical Scaling**
