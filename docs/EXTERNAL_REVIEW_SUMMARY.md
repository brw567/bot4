## ðŸ”´ Critical Blockers (Both Reviews Agree)

### Priority 1 - IMMEDIATE

#### 1. Memory Management (Day 2 Sprint - TOMORROW)
**Impact**: Blocks ALL performance targets
- **Issue**: No MiMalloc = +1Î¼s latency overhead
- **Fix**: 
  - Implement MiMalloc globally (<10ns allocation)
  - Create TLS-backed object pools (Orders: 10k, Signals: 100k, Ticks: 1M)
  - SPSC rings for market data, bounded MPMC for control
- **Owner**: Jordan
- **Deadline**: 48 hours

#### 2. Parallelization
**Impact**: Single-threaded bottleneck
- **Issue**: No Rayon = missing 8-11x speedup
- **Fix**:
  - Integrate Rayon with 11 workers (12-core system)
  - CPU pinning (cores 1-11, main on 0)
  - Per-core sharding by instrument
- **Owner**: Sam
- **Deadline**: 72 hours

#### 3. Doc Alignment
**Impact**: 40+ errors in documentation sync
- **Issue**: Phase 3.5 missing from docs, mismatched IDs
- **Fix**:
  - Run check_doc_alignment.py in CI
  - Sync all docs with PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_MASTER.md
  - Add Phase 3.5 everywhere
- **Owner**: Alex
- **Deadline**: 24 hours

### Priority 2 - HIGH

#### 4. Statistical Tests (Nexus Requirement)
**Impact**: Mathematical validation incomplete
- **Tests Needed**:
  - ADF for stationarity
  - Jarque-Bera for normality
  - Ljung-Box for autocorrelation
  - DCC-GARCH for dynamic correlations
  - Copulas for tail dependencies
- **Owner**: Morgan
- **Status**: Module created, needs integration

#### 5. Performance Gates CI (Sophia Requirement)
**Impact**: Can't verify performance claims
- **Gates**:
  - Risk check p99 â‰¤10Î¼s
  - Order internal p99 â‰¤100Î¼s
  - Throughput â‰¥500k ops/s
- **Status**: CI workflow created, needs benchmarks

#### 6. Exchange Simulator (Sophia Requirement)
**Impact**: Can't test real market conditions
- **Features**:
  - Rate limits (20-50/s typical)
  - Partial fills
  - Cancel/amend flows
  - Reconnection chaos
- **Owner**: Casey
- **Deadline**: 1 week

## ðŸ“Š Quantitative Metrics

### Nexus's Statistical Requirements
| Test | Purpose | Status | Priority |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| ADF | Stationarity | Created | HIGH |
| Jarque-Bera | Normality | Created | HIGH |
| Ljung-Box | Autocorrelation | Created | MEDIUM |
| DCC-GARCH | Dynamic correlations | Created | HIGH |
| Copulas | Tail dependencies | Created | MEDIUM |

### Performance Targets (Agreed)
| Metric | Target | Current | Gap |
|--------|--------|---------|-----|
| Decision p99 | â‰¤1Î¼s | ~58ns (CB only) | Need full path |
| Risk check p99 | â‰¤10Î¼s | ~9.8Î¼s | âœ… Close |
| Order internal p99 | â‰¤100Î¼s | ~98Î¼s | âœ… Close |
| Throughput | â‰¥500k ops/s | Unknown | Need benches |

### Confidence Levels
- **Sophia**: CONDITIONAL (would allocate capital after fixes)
- **Nexus**: 65% confidence (needs statistical validation)
- **Combined**: ~70% ready for production
