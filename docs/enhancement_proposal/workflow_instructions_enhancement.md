# Workflow Instructions Enhancement Proposal

**Date**: 2025-01-10
**Author**: Alex (Team Lead)
**Status**: PENDING REVIEW

## 📋 Overview

This proposal outlines enhancements to our workflow instructions to maximize effectiveness with Claude Client and ensure consistent, high-quality development practices across all team members.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Formalize the development workflow in Claude configuration
2. Enhance agent-specific instructions for better role clarity
3. Implement automatic quality gates and verification
4. Establish clear traceability between code, architecture, and tasks
5. Ensure 100% test success rate without shortcuts

## 📝 Proposed Enhanced Instructions

### 1. Core Workflow Instructions (CLAUDE.md Enhancement)

```markdown
## Development Workflow Protocol

### Phase 1: Task Reception & Analysis
When receiving any task, issue, or finding:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Create grooming session document in `/docs/grooming_sessions/`
   - Update TodoWrite with task breakdown
   - Check for related existing issues in TASK_LIST.md

2. **Team Grooming Session** (MANDATORY):
   - All relevant agents must participate
   - Document each agent's perspective
   - Identify enhancement opportunities
   - Reach consensus on approach
   - Break down into sub-tasks (max 10 per parent task)

### Phase 2: Design & Consensus
1. **Architecture Review**:
   - Check ARCHITECTURE.md for existing patterns
   - Propose architectural changes if needed
   - Document design decisions with rationale

2. **Consensus Building**:
   - Maximum 3 rounds of debate
   - Document dissenting opinions
   - Alex makes final decision if deadlock

3. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Each sub-task must be atomic and testable
   - Assign effort estimates (S/M/L/XL)
   - Update TASK_LIST.md immediately
   - Link tasks to architecture components

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Code Standards**:
   - Every file must include header comment with:
     ```python
     """
     Component: [Name from ARCHITECTURE.md]
     Task: [Task ID from TASK_LIST.md]
     Author: [Agent Name]
     Tests: [Test file path]
     Architecture: [Link to ARCHITECTURE.md section]
     """
     ```

2. **Quality Requirements**:
   - NO mock implementations allowed
   - NO simplified versions for testing
   - ALL functionality must be production-ready
   - Tests must cover real scenarios, not mocks

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - 100% test success rate REQUIRED
   - Minimum 80% code coverage
   - Integration tests mandatory
   - Performance tests for critical paths

### Phase 4: Verification & Documentation
1. **Pre-Completion Checklist**:
   - [ ] All tests passing (100%)
   - [ ] TASK_LIST.md updated
   - [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md updated
   - [ ] Code comments reference architecture
   - [ ] Grooming session documented
   - [ ] Enhancement opportunities identified

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - ARCHITECTURE.md must reflect implementation
   - Include sequence diagrams for complex flows
   - Document design patterns used
   - Add performance characteristics

### Phase 5: Continuous Improvement
1. **Post-Implementation Review**:
   - Identify lessons learned
   - Document in `/docs/lessons_learned/`
   - Update best practices

2. **Enhancement Tracking**:
   - Create follow-up tasks for improvements
   - Prioritize based on value/effort
   - Schedule in next sprint
```

### 3. Automated Enforcement Mechanisms

#### Git Hooks Enhancement
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check for grooming session
if ! grep -q "grooming_session" $(git diff --cached --name-only); then
  echo "ERROR: No grooming session found for this change"
  echo "Create one in /docs/grooming_sessions/"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for architecture reference
for file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.(py|js|ts)$'); do
  if ! grep -q "Architecture:" "$file"; then
    echo "ERROR: $file missing Architecture reference"
    exit 1
  fi
  if ! grep -q "Task:" "$file"; then
    echo "ERROR: $file missing Task ID reference"
    exit 1
  fi
done

# Run tests
pytest tests/ || exit 1

# Check test coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report --fail-under=80 || exit 1

# Validate no fakes
python scripts/validate_no_fakes.py || exit 1

# Check TASK_LIST.md is updated
if ! git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "TASK_LIST.md"; then
  echo "WARNING: TASK_LIST.md not updated"
fi
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality-check.yml
name: Quality Enforcement

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Grooming Session
        run: |
          if [ ! -f "docs/grooming_sessions/$(date +%Y%m%d)*.md" ]; then
            echo "Missing grooming session"
            exit 1
          fi
      
      - name: Verify Architecture Links
        run: python scripts/verify_architecture_links.py
      
      - name: Test Coverage
        run: |
          pytest --cov=src tests/
          coverage report --fail-under=80
      
      - name: No Fakes Validation
        run: python scripts/validate_no_fakes.py
      
      - name: Architecture Consistency
        run: python scripts/validate_architecture_consistency.py
```
