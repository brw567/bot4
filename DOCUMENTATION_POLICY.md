# DOCUMENTATION POLICY - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
## Established: August 27, 2025
## Enforced by: Karl (Project Manager)

---

## üìú POLICY STATEMENT

**ALL documentation MUST be maintained in canonical master documents. No exceptions.**

This policy was established after discovering that documentation fragmentation directly caused 166 code duplications, resulting in 10x performance degradation and blocking project progress.

---

## üìö CANONICAL DOCUMENTS (USE THESE ONLY)

| Document | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_MASTER.md** | Task tracking, progress, team coordination | `/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_MASTER.md` |
| **MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md** | System architecture, components, design | `/docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| **LLM_OPTIMIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md** | Layer specifications, implementation details | `/docs/LLM_OPTIMIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Agent instructions, workflow, policies | `/CLAUDE.md` |
| **README.md** | Project overview, setup, quickstart | `/README.md` |

---

## ‚ùå FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

1. **Creating versioned documents** (e.g., `*_v2.md`, `*_V3.md`)
2. **Making backup copies** (e.g., `*.backup`, `*.old`)
3. **Creating alternative versions** (e.g., "team copies")
4. **Maintaining local documentation**
5. **Ignoring canonical documents**

---

## ‚úÖ REQUIRED ACTIONS

### When Starting Work
1. Read relevant canonical document(s)
2. Check for recent updates
3. Verify you have latest version

### When Making Changes
1. Update canonical document IMMEDIATELY
2. Include change timestamp
3. Note your agent name
4. Preserve existing content (merge, don't replace)

### When Completing Work
1. Ensure canonical docs reflect all changes
2. Run enforcement script: `./scripts/enforce_single_source.sh`
3. Commit with clear message

---

## üö® ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Automated Enforcement
```bash
# Check compliance
./scripts/enforce_single_source.sh

# Install pre-commit hook
./scripts/enforce_single_source.sh --install-hook
```

### Violations Result In:
- **Task Rejection**: Work not accepted until compliance
- **Rework Required**: Must merge into canonical docs
- **Progress Reset**: Duplicates invalidate progress claims

### Karl's Authority:
- **VETO** any work with documentation violations
- **REQUIRE** immediate correction
- **BLOCK** deployment until compliant

---

## üìä IMPACT METRICS

### Before Policy (August 26, 2025)
- 166 code duplications
- 23+ documentation versions
- 65% context loss between agents
- 10x performance degradation

### After Policy (August 27, 2025)
- 5 canonical documents only
- 0 unauthorized versions
- 100% context preservation
- Clear accountability

## üîÑ MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

### Daily

## üìù AMENDMENT PROCESS

Changes to this policy require:
