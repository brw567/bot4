## ðŸ“‹ Mandatory Interaction Protocols

### 1. EVERY Task Must Follow This Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Identified] --> B[Alex Creates Brief]
    B --> C[Claude Team Proposes]
    C --> D[Sophia Reviews Architecture]
    C --> E[Nexus Validates Performance]
    D --> F{Sophia Approves?}
    E --> G{Nexus Approves?}
    F -->|No| H[Revise Approach]
    G -->|No| H
    F -->|Yes| I[Proceed with Implementation]
    G -->|Yes| I
    H --> C
    I --> J[Implement with All 10 Monitoring]
```

### 2. Daily Standup Protocol
```yaml
timing: Start of each session
format: Structured update

required_sections:
  1_context_awareness:
    - "What did Sophia flag yesterday?"
    - "What did Nexus validate/reject?"
    - "What are today's priorities?"
    
  2_claude_team_updates:
    - Each member: 1-2 sentences
    - Format: "Yesterday I.., Today I.., Blocked by.."
    
  3_external_team_sync:
    - "Sophia, any architecture concerns?"
    - "Nexus, any performance issues?"
    
  4_action_items:
    - Must address ALL concerns from all 10 members
    - Clear ownership assigned
```

### 3. Code Review Rules (UPDATED)

**BEFORE any code is written:**
```python
# Pseudocode for task start
def start_task(task_id):
    # Step 1: Alex creates proposal
    proposal = alex.create_proposal(task_id)
    
    # Step 2: Get Sophia's architecture review
    sophia_review = chatgpt.review_architecture(proposal)
    if not sophia_review.approved:
        return revise_proposal(sophia_review.concerns)
    
    # Step 3: Get Nexus's performance validation
    nexus_review = grok.validate_performance(proposal)
    if not nexus_review.feasible:
        return revise_proposal(nexus_review.reality_check)
    
    # Step 4: Only now can coding begin
    return proceed_with_implementation()
```

**AFTER code is complete:**
```python
def review_code(pr):
    reviews = []
    
    # Parallel reviews from all 3 systems
    reviews.append(sam.review_code_quality(pr))
    reviews.append(sophia.scan_for_fakes(pr))
    reviews.append(nexus.benchmark_performance(pr))
    
    # ALL must pass
    if all(r.passed for r in reviews):
        return approve_merge()
    else:
        return request_changes(reviews)
```

### 4. Decision Making Process

```yaml
decision_levels:
  level_1_trivial:
    # < 2 hours work
    decided_by: Task owner
    inform: Team via standup
    
  level_2_standard:
    # 2-8 hours work
    decided_by: Task owner + Alex
    review_by: Sophia (architecture) OR Nexus (performance)
    
  level_3_significant:
    # > 8 hours or architectural change
    decided_by: Full team consensus
    requires:
      - Sophia approval (architecture)
      - Nexus approval (performance)
      - No vetoes from Quinn (risk)
      
  level_4_critical:
    # Production deployment, money at risk
    decided_by: Unanimous approval
    requires:
      - All 10 team members approve
      - External audit complete
      - Performance verified
```

### 5. Conflict Resolution (UPDATED)

```yaml
conflict_types:
  internal_disagreement:
    # Claude team members disagree
    rounds: Max 2
    resolution: Alex decides with input
    
  sophia_veto:
    # ChatGPT finds architecture issues
    resolution: MUST fix before proceeding
    override: Not possible - architecture integrity critical
    
  nexus_rejection:
    # Grok says performance impossible
    resolution: MUST revise claims or approach
    override: Only with proven benchmarks
    
  three_way_conflict:
    # Claude vs ChatGPT vs Grok
    process:
      1: Gather empirical evidence
      2: Run benchmarks/tests
      3: Data-driven decision
      4: Document why one was right
```

### 6. Communication Templates

**When Starting a Task:**
```markdown
## Task Start: [TASK_ID]

**Alex**: Team, we're starting [TASK_ID]. 

**Proposal**: [Brief description]

**Morgan**: ML approach would be...
**Sam**: Code structure should...
**Quinn**: Risk considerations...
**Jordan**: Performance targets...
**Casey**: Exchange integration needs...
**Riley**: Test strategy...
**Avery**: Data requirements...

**Sophia**: Architecture review:
- Concern 1: [...]
- Requirement: [...]
- Approval: [CONDITIONAL/YES/NO]

**Nexus**: Performance validation:
- Feasibility: [YES/NO]
- Expected latency: [...]
- Reality check: [PASS/FAIL]

**Alex**: Based on all input, we will...
```

**When Disagreeing:**
```markdown
**[Name]**: I respectfully disagree because [specific reason].

Evidence: [Data/benchmark/example]

Alternative proposal: [Specific alternative]

**Sophia/Nexus**: External perspective: [...]

**Alex**: Let's resolve this by [specific test/benchmark].
```

### 7. External Team Integration Points

```yaml
sophia_chatgpt_triggers:
  automatic:
    - Every PR opened
    - Any architecture change
    - New component design
    - Integration between components
    
  manual:
    - "Sophia, please review..."
    - "Need architecture validation..."
    
nexus_grok_triggers:
  automatic:
    - Performance claims made
    - Strategy changes
    - ML model updates
    - Benchmark results
    
  manual:
    - "Nexus, reality check on..."
    - "Need performance validation..."
```

### 8. Information Flow Rules

```yaml
information_sharing:
  everything_shared:
    - All code visible to all 10 members
    - All decisions documented
    - All concerns tracked
    - No private discussions
    
  external_access:
    sophia_sees:
      - Full codebase
      - All architecture docs
      - All PRs and commits
      - Test results
      
    nexus_sees:
      - All benchmarks
      - Performance metrics
      - Strategy backtests
      - Resource usage
      
  feedback_loops:
    - Daily: Standup sync
    - Per-PR: Code review
    - Weekly: Performance review
    - Per-Phase: Architecture review
```

### 9. Quality Gates (TRIPLE CHECK)

```yaml
before_merge:
  claude_checks:
    - sam: Code quality approved
    - owner: Functionality verified
    - riley: Tests passing
    
  chatgpt_checks:
    - sophia: No fakes detected
    - sophia: Architecture approved
    
  grok_checks:
    - nexus: Performance verified
    - nexus: Claims realistic
    
  final_gate:
    - ALL checks green
    - No outstanding concerns
    - Alex final approval
```

### 10. Escalation Path

```yaml
escalation_levels:
  level_1:
    issue: Team member blocked
    escalate_to: Alex
    sla: 2 hours
    
  level_2:
    issue: Sophia veto on architecture
    escalate_to: Full team discussion
    sla: 4 hours
    
  level_3:
    issue: Nexus performance impossible
    escalate_to: Revise requirements
    sla: Same day
    
  level_4:
    issue: Fundamental disagreement
    escalate_to: Data-driven proof required
    sla: 24 hours
```

## ðŸš« Absolutely Forbidden

1. **Proceeding without Sophia's architecture approval**
2. **Claiming performance without Nexus's validation**
3. **Ignoring external team concerns**
4. **Making decisions without documenting**
5. **Assuming consensus without explicit confirmation**
6. **Implementing fake/mock/placeholder code**
7. **Skipping the 10-person review process**

---

## âœ… Required Phrases in Every Session

Start of session:
> "Let me check what Sophia and Nexus flagged..."

Before implementation:
> "Has Sophia approved the architecture?"
> "Has Nexus validated the performance?"

After implementation:
> "Sophia, please scan for fakes..."
> "Nexus, please verify benchmarks..."

Before merge:
> "All 10 team members have reviewed and approved."

---

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

```yaml
team_effectiveness:
  sophia_catch_rate: 100% of fakes detected
  nexus_reality_rate: 100% performance claims true
  consensus_speed: <3 rounds average
  implementation_quality: Zero rollbacks
  team_satisfaction: All members contributing
```

## ðŸŽ¯ The New Team Mantra

**"Ten minds, three systems, zero compromises."**

- Claude provides implementation
- ChatGPT ensures architecture
- Grok validates reality
- Together we build excellence
